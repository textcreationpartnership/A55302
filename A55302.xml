            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>THERE are three admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Unions noted by Divines; the eſſential Union of the Three perſons in the Sacred Trinity; the Hypoſtatical Union of the divine and humane natures in the Perſon of Chriſt: and the Myſtical Union which is between Chriſt and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. In the firſt we have ſalvation in the primary fountain of it; in the ſecond we have it in the channel or excellent medium of it: in the third we have it in the application or actual poſſeſſion of it. The Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an Immenſe Ocean of mercy and goodneſs, but it flows out to us only in and through a Mediator; Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator of Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:60571:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>righteouſneſs and merit; but he communicates himſelf only to thoſe that are in union with him, All our righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Caput &amp; membra ſunt quaſi una perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na myſtica, ideò ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fideles pertinet. Aqu. <hi>3.</hi> pars. quaeſt. <hi>48.</hi> Art. <hi>2.</hi> Fiant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti, ſi volunt vivere de Spiritu Chriſti. <hi>Auſt.</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> Tract. <hi>26.</hi> In <hi>3.</hi> part. Thom. qu. <hi>49.</hi>
               </note> grace, peace, ſalvation depends on that Union. If we are in him, then his ſatisfactory righteouſneſs covers us, his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwells in us; but if we are out of him, then our caſe is as deſperate as if he had never ſatisfied juſtice, as if he had never merited grace and eternal life for us. Moſt true is that of <hi>Medina, Tota ratio noſtrae ſalutis in eo conſiſtit, ut induamus Chriſtum,</hi> the total ſum of our ſalvation ſtands in this, That we put on Chriſt; who (as a learned man hath it) is in his imputed righteouſneſs as an artificial garment to us; and in his imparted graces, as a natural one. This myſtical union (which is of ſuch high concern to our ſalvation) is very ſignally ſet forth in Scripture; There it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt dwells in
<pb facs="tcp:60571:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Believers, and they in him; he abides in them, and they in him:</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions point out a mutual inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of <hi>him</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> But, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this myſtery is very deep) the Holy Ghoſt, in condeſcenſion to our weakneſs, ſhadows out this Union by many earthly patterns, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Law-union of a King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; by the Love-union of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife; by the Artificial union of the Foundation and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; by the Natural union of the Vine and Branches, the Head and Members; by the intimate union and incorporation of the Food and the Body. There is that in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union which anſwer; to all theſe earthly patterns; and withal, that which as much exceeds them, as a ſubſtance doth a ſhadow. The bonds of this union are Faith and the Holy Spirit; Faith ſees, comes to, receives, leans on, puts on, feeds
<pb facs="tcp:60571:4"/>upon Chriſt, as being the univerſal capacity to take in Chriſt into the Soul; the Holy Spirit is <hi>primaria commiſſura,</hi> the primary ligature, which knits us to Chriſt: That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which is, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Patris &amp; filii communio</hi>) brings us into union with Chriſt; that Spirit (which united the two natures in Chriſt) unites us to Chriſt: Hence we become myſtical parts of him, of his fleſh and of his bone; nay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one ſpirit with him. The Seals of this union are Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Baptiſm is called by an Ancient, <hi>Chriſtianiſmi inveſtitura,</hi> in it we are ſaid to be buried with Chriſt, and to be riſen with him; which is notably adumbrated by the baptiſmal immerſion into the water, and eduction out of it. In the Lords Supper the body and blood of Chriſt are really, though ſpiritually, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our Faith; we may eat his
<pb facs="tcp:60571:4"/>fleſh and drink his blood unto life eternal; we are (as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks) united to him <hi>ſpiritali tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitione,</hi> by a ſpiritual tranſition or paſſing into him; and (as St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> hath it) we are united to his body as that is to the word. The priviledges of this union are ſo great, that they are worthy to attract all men into conjunction with Chriſt; the marks of this union are ſo plain in Scripture, that Believers reflecting on themſelves may have the comfort of their being in him. Theſe are the things that the enſuing diſcourſe offers to the Reader, with this only requeſt, that he would <hi>agnoſcere quod Dei eſt, and ignoſcere quod hominis eſt;</hi> If any glory may come to Chriſt, or comfort to his members by this Treatiſe, it is enough, and as much as is aimed at by him, who is</p>

               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. I.</label> MIllions in the Church miſcarry for want of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt: This is cleared from the two Covenants, of Works and of Grace; from the two heads <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt; from the two ways and periods of mankind. Two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions with Chriſt, one in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, another in truth: this latter is a myſtery, it carries a reſpect to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Sacred perſons in Trinity, and to the hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of two natures in Chriſt; it depends on them, it reſembles them, it is that the hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion aims at; it is not to be meaſured by human Reaſon, but by Scripture.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. II.</label> The Scripture uſeth Metaphors to expreſs holy Myſteries by, becauſe the myſteries are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime;
<pb facs="tcp:60571:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe it would make us ſeek the things above. It ſets forth the myſtical union by reſemblances. There is an analogy between it and other unions; an excellency in it above them. It ſets forth the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union by that between a King and his Subjects. The myſtical union exceeds in the worthineſs and nearneſs of the perſons united; in the rightneſs of Laws and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; in the intimacy of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the benefits of government; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in protection and rewards.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. III.</label> The Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal one. There is a mutual conſent between Chriſt and believers. The believers conſent imports a right knowledg, a free choice, and a preſent compliance with Chriſt. Chriſts conſent is purely gratuitous; believers purely ſupernatural. Chriſt and believers mutually make over themſelves each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Emphaſis of that phraſe (<hi>one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>) opened. There is an intimate love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and believers: he put on an humane nature for them, they put off a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature for him. He died for expiation, they die in mortification. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of good things from Chriſt to
<pb facs="tcp:60571:6"/>the Church; the Church propagates in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and good works. The myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by that of a foundation and a building. Chriſt laid, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers built on him by Divine Art. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cement of faith and the holy Spirit. Chriſt is a large and ſtrong foundation; he bears up the Church by Divine influences.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. IV.</label> The Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by the Vine and the Branches. Chriſt hath one nature with Believers; they are as branches in him, and receive juice from him. The myſtical union ſet forth by the natural head and the body. Thoſe two famous Texts, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 16. Col. 2. 19.</hi> conſidered, which import more than when Chriſt is called Head over all things, Head of principality and power, Head of every man, Head of the Heathen, or Head of the Church as an Husband. Chriſt as an Head hath the ſame nature with Believers; but exceeds them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as being firſt and higheſt; in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being full of Grace; in virtue, as influencing into the Church. The neceſſity, matter, and way of this influence. Chriſt an Head above all other heads, as making of no member a member; and as having virtue enough for a world.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:60571:7"/>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. V.</label> The myſtical union ſet forth by that between the food and the body. Chriſt is the true food. He ſtrengthens againſt the curſing Law. He ſtrengthens unto all duties. He is united to Believers. He is food by way of eminency. Several concluſions drawn from the reſemblances, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and Believers is not meerly a political one. That it is not meerly a moral one. Several reaſons to prove the ſame. That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion affords ſupport to Believers. That it gives a vital influence to them. That it is a very intimate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That it hath a great myſtery in it. That it is very laſting and durable.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. VI.</label> There are two Bonds of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Faith and the Holy Spirit. Faith ſees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiates Chriſt to the Believer; it puts the ſoul into an apt poſture for him; it gives a right to him; it intimately unites to him. The Spirit it ſelf is in ſome ſort communicated to Believers; he is ſent to them; he is given to them; he dwells in them; his ſpecial, operative, immediate preſence is with them; he forms Holy
<pb facs="tcp:60571:7"/>Graces in them; he actuates and preſerves thoſe Graces; he ſheds abroad Gods Love in their heart. In all theſe Operations, two things are noted, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomewhat of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt; and ſomewhat of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Spirit.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. VII.</label> The Seals of the myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion are Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Baptiſm is a Seal of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, not to all, but to Believers. Some Infants are in their infancy in union with Chriſt; ſome come to it afterwards: ſome never attain to it. The Lords Supper is a Seal to confirm and exhibit Chriſt to us. The preſence of Chriſt in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is not a corporal one. The Bread and Wine are not (as the Papiſts ſay) turned into his Body and Blood. His Body and Blood are not (as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay) in, with, and under the Bread and Wine. The preſence of Chriſt is ſpiritual. He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objectively to our Faith, and virtually in the communicate Spirit. Alſo the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt is not oral, but ſpiritual.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:60571:8"/>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. VIII.</label> The Priviledges of thoſe that are in Chriſt are great. Chriſts righteouſneſs is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively derived upon them, to deliver them from wrath, to intitle them to life eternal. Chriſt is their Advocate above; he pleads for them, that they may have pardon; the ſpirit, acceſs to God. They are adopted in him; as ſons they have a freedom in holy things, a continual indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from God, an heavenly inheritance. They have the Holy Spirit in them, it lives, breathes, moves, operates in them. They have communion with God; their ſervices anſwer to his call; his communications an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their ſervices. They are happy in every condition; in proſperity their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are pure; in adverſity they have God with them; and admirably appearing to them.

                  <label>CHAP. IX.</label> The Marks of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion conſidered. In general, the marks are internal, no meer outward thing is a mark; the marks are cordial, no meer notion is a mark; the marks are ſupernatural, no meer moral virtue is a
<pb facs="tcp:60571:8"/>mark. In particular, The firſt mark is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Spirit; the ſecond is an high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt; the third is a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Bonds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, the Spirit and Faith; the fourth is a conformity to Chriſt; a conformity to him in Graces, in the riſe of them, and in the kinds; a conformity to him in Sufferings, in the mortification of Sin, and in bearing of the Croſs; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him in his reſurrection, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of mind, and newneſs of life in matter and manner. The concluſion in two words of advice; one to thoſe that are not in union with him, the other to thoſe that are in union with him.</item>

               <argument>
                  <p>Millions in the Church miſcarry for want of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt: This is cleared from the two Covenants, of Works and Grace; from the two heads <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt; from the two ways and periods of mankind. Two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions with Chriſt, one in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, another in truth: this latter is a myſtery, it carries a reſpect to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Sacred perſons in Trinity, and to the hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of two natures in Chriſt;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60571:10"/>it depends on them, it reſembles them, it is that the hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion aims at; it is not to be meaſured by human Reaſon, but by Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REAT preparations are made in the Goſpel, for the ſalvation of men; there God proclaims him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in rich titles of grace and mercy; Chriſt is ſet forth as an All-ſufficient Saviour and Redeemer: His blood is a Laver able to waſh away all ſin; his treaſures of grace are enough to ſupply all wants. In his precepts we have the true way of holineſs and righteouſneſs manifeſted to us; in his Promiſes we have an heaven of life and immortality opened before our eyes; all things are ready on Gods part, one would think they ſhould be ſo on mans, whoſe elective faculty and inſtinct after happineſs might in all reaſon prompt him to accept of ſo great an offer. Nevertheleſs, Millions in the boſom of the Church utterly miſcarry; their ſins are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, their ſouls are unſanctified, the pure way of holineſs is forſaken, Heaven the region of bliſs is loſt; and, which is the prodigy of corrupt nature, they run into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60571:10"/>perdition, as if it were, what it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be, their choice or option.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is, becauſe they are not, nor will be united to Jeſus Chriſt. We find them drowning in ſenſual pleaſures, or earthing themſelves in worldly profits, or breathing after popular air and vain-glory; but they will not come to Chriſt to waſh in his Blood, or ſubject to his Scepter, or tread in his holy ſteps, that they may live for ever; ſo they periſh, as if there were no Sayiour or Goſpel. Two or three things will make this evident.</p>
               <p>There are Two Covenants, the one of Works, which runs thus, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> the other of Grace, which runs thus, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and live:</hi> the firſt in congruity to man in his primitive integrity, calls for perfect ſinleſs obedience; the other in condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to man in his fallen eſtate, asks only faith. All men, as ſinners, being ſhort of the firſt Covenant, none can be ſaved but by the ſecond; nor by that neither, unleſs they be united to Chriſt; the Charter of ſalvation gives nothing to thoſe who are in a ſeparate eſtate from the fountain: the unbeliever, who is ſo, is condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; condemned by the firſt Covenant, and not ſaved by the ſecond.</p>
               <p>There are two Heads, <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60571:11"/>both communicate to thoſe who are theirs; <hi>Adam</hi> communicates ſin and death to his poſterity; Chriſt communicates righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and life to his believing ſeed. There being nothing but ſin and death from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> none can be ſaved but by the ſecond; nor by him neither, unleſs they be in conjunction with him. He is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the body, there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who are in him, nor nothing elſe to thoſe who are out of him.</p>
               <p>There are two ways, and two periods of mankind; thoſe who are in Chriſt, walk after the ſpirit in the pure way of holineſs, and ſo paſs on to that Heaven which is the center of ſanctity; thoſe who ſtay in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in a ſtate of corruption, walk after the fleſh, in a way of diſobedience, and ſo paſs on to that Hell which is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of iniquity.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, That Union with Chriſt, is the critical point upon which eternal life and death depend; upon this account the Apoſtle exhorts us to examine our ſelves in this great concern, <hi>Know ye not, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. Which is as much as to ſay, if Chriſt took our fleſh, and we have not his ſpirit; if he were a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and we are not ſprinkled with his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60571:11"/>blood; if he roſe again from the dead, and we are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits us not at all: To us, as an<note n="*" place="margin">Sunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nondum natus eſt Chriſtus, nondum eſt paſſus, non ſurrexit uſ<expan>

               <p>Union is a very extenſive term, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers reckon up many kinds of it; ſome learned men diſtinguiſh Unity, Unition and Union. Unity is of one individual thing; Union is of more than one met in conjunction; Unition is the act of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which joins things together. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the ſtate of the united, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the unitive act. There may be Union without Unition; between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſacred Trinity there is an Union, but (it being an eternal one) Unition (which imports a temporal act) can have no place therein; but in all temporal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons an Unition cannot be wanting, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60571:12"/>being it which tacks things together, and of two makes them in a ſort to become one. In Union both the extremes are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but both are not always changed: Thus in the Union of the Divine nature in Chriſt with the humane; the change is not in the Divine nature, but only in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which is taken into one perſon with the Divine.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>, in truth and reality; thus belivers are united to him; as ſubjects they are under him; as living ſtones they are built on him; as a dear Spouſe they are joined to him; as fruitful branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they are implanted into him; as myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal members they are incorporated into him; there is a kind of ſpiritual continuity between him and them; that holy Spirit which reſides in him, falls down in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon them: The Scripture ſignally ſets forth this Union, He dwells in believers, and they in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56. He abides in them, and they in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. He is in them the hope of Glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. And they are in him that is true, in Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20.

Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is in him; and they having the Son, have life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 12. He is one fleſh with them, and they are one ſpirit with him. Theſe things ſhew, that there is a real union between them.</p>
               <p>This real union (which is what I aim
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60571:14"/>at) is by Divines ſtiled a myſtical one, and that upon very good reaſon; the Holy Ghoſt, in Scripture, calls it a myſtery; that is, it is a Divine Secret, or holy Arcanam, above humane reaſon, and only conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by a ſupernatural light.<note place="margin">De Eccleſ. viſib. <hi>464.</hi>

               <p>There are three admirable Unions; the eſſential union of three perſons in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity. <hi>Theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. <hi>5.7.</hi> That is, one in eſſence. The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane natures in the perſon of Chriſt; <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs; God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. The myſtical union which is between Chriſt and his Church; <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones; this is a great myſtery; but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church, ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> Epheſ. 5.30, and 32. Touching theſe three unions,

                  </note> an Ancient hath obſerved, That all three may be ſeen in Chriſt; he hath a Father (I may add, and a Spirit) with whom he is one ſubſtance; he hath an humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with which he is one perſon; he hath adhering Believers, with whom he is one Spirit: Unto this obſervation I ſhall add another; the myſtical Union (which is the laſt of the three) bears a reſpect to the two former. Two or three things will manifeſt this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The myſtical union depends upon the two former; a hint of this we have in the words of our Saviour, who (ſpeaking of himſelf as God-man, and of giving his fleſh for the life of the World) ſaith, <hi>As the living father hath ſent me, and I live by the father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me,</hi> Joh. 6.57. Here are, <hi>tres viveatis,</hi> three livers one under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Father, who is, <hi>fons Trinitatis,</hi> the fountain of the Trinity, lives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Chriſt lives by the Father: as he is the Word, he hath life from him by the eternal generation; as he is man, he hath it by the hypoſtatical union. The believer who ſpiritually eats Chriſt, lives by him:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60571:15"/>Conjunction with the Father, is that by which Chriſt lives; conjunction with Chriſt is that by which the Believer lives: were there no eſſential union, there could be no hypoſtatical one; which ſuppoſes, that the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume an humane nature made by all three. Incarnation (ſay the Schoolmen) is <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectivè,</hi> belonging to the whole Trinity; but, <hi>terminativè,</hi> it is peculiar to the Son, who is the alone term unto which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is aſſumed: were there no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical union, there could be no myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal one; which imports, that belivers are united unto God-man. Were he only God, how ſhould we fallen creatures ever have an immediate approach unto him? or if we could, what uſe would there be of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? It is through him, as Mediator, that we have acceſs to the Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. The way into the holy of holies, lies through the vail of his fleſh. Were he only man, to what purpoſe ſhould we be united to a meer creature? or how ſhould we dare to fix our faith on ſuch an one? To truſt in a meer man, is a curſe; to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a meer creature, a piece of Idolatry: Believers therefore are united to God-man; the myſtical union depends upon the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical, and the hypoſtatical upon the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60571:16"/>Without a Sacred Trinity, there would be no God-man; without God-man, there would be no fit perſon for Blievers to be united unto.</p>
               <p>Again, There is in the myſtical union, a ſhadow or dark reſemblance of the two other unions: There is a reſemblance of the eſſential union. This is hinted in our Saviours Prayer, <hi>As thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> Joh. <hi>17.21.</hi> From which words St. <hi>Hilary</hi> concludes,<note place="margin">De Trinit. Lib. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> That the union between Chriſt and Believers, is not meerly a moral union of will and affections; for then our Saviour (who is the eternal Word, and knew how to ſpeak) would have prayed thus, <hi>Pater, ſicut nos unum volumus, ita &amp; illi unum velint, &amp; unum per concordiam ſimus omnes.</hi> Father, as we will one and the ſame thing, ſo let them alſo do, and let us all be one by concord; But (inſtead thereof) our Saviour prays thus, <hi>As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> The particle <hi>(as)</hi> notes ſome kind of ſimilitude; the words <hi>(thou father art in me, and I in thee)</hi> note out the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or mutual inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the Father and Son; a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of which we have in the myſtical union, which in Scripture is expreſſed by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60571:16"/>the mutual inexiſtence of Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; he is in them, and they in him; he dwells in them, and they in him: Very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable are the words of our Saviour, <hi>I am in the father, and you in me, and I in you,</hi> Joh. 14.20. We have here in one Text mentioned the high myſtery of the Sacred Trinity, and the myſtical union to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Firſt, The inexiſtence of the Son in the Father, and (which is implied and to be underſtood) of the Father in the Son, is ſignified; and then immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the mutual inexiſtence of Chriſt and Believers; which ſhews that in this latter there is a reſemblance of the former. Again, there is in the myſtical union a reſemblance of the hypoſtatical one; this I gather from the likeneſs of thoſe Scripture-phraſes which expreſs both the unions; Chriſt was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.20. And Believers are born of the ſame holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. In Chriſt dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. And Believers are filled with all the fulneſs of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. The word dwelt or tabernacled among us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. And touching Believers it is ſaid, <hi>The tabernacle of God is with men,</hi> Rev. 21.3. which is in part attained in this life, and in full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the other. In Chriſt the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60571:17"/>anointed the manhood; and in every ſupernatural act of Believers, weakneſs is anointed with power. The Schoolmen note in Chriſt a threefold Grace, the grace of union, in that his human nature was united to the Deity; the grace of unction, in that his humane nature was anointed with the holy Spirit; the grace of headſhip, in that he is head unto the Church. Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in believers may be noted a threefold grace, the grace of union, in that they are united unto Chriſt; the grace of unction, in that they are anointed with the holy Spirit; and the grace of memberſhip, in that they have all their graces from Chriſt their Head. Moreover, the three Sacred perſons in the bleſſed Trinity are for ever perfectly happy in the eſſential union; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, it was the eternal pleaſure, that in one of the three there ſhould be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical one; the Son of God aſſumed an humane nature, but he reſted not there; <hi>Corpus Chriſti naturale fuit ſacramentum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris myſtici;</hi> beſides his natural body, he would have a myſtical one; he came in the fleſh that he might dye for us; and he died, that he might gather together in one the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.52. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, into one myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body. The hypoſtatical union aimed at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60571:17"/>a ſatisfactory paſſion, and that paſſion aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a myſtical union.</p>
               <p>This Union being a myſtery, and that depending on two greater myſteries than it ſelf; two concluſions offer themſelves to us.</p>
               <p>The one is this; The myſtical union is not properly to be judged or meaſured by humane reaſon: Nay, a learned man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſaith, <hi>Ne Angelica mens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cam. de Eccl. <hi>222.</hi>
                  </note> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical mind cannot comprehend it in its full dignity. To explain this, I ſhall lay down ſome diſtinctions:</p>
               <p>There is a double ſphear, one of meer nature, another of ſupernatural revelation; in the firſt, it is proper for humane reaſon to ſearch out things, and dive into the cauſes and effects thereof; yet in doing of it there is many a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and things are ſeen rather in their garb and inveſting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, than in their pure and naked eſſence. In the ſecond it is proper for faith to come and ſubſcribe to the ſacred Oracle, even in things above Reaſon, without ſo much as asking any <hi>how's</hi> or <hi>why's.</hi> It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infidelity (ſaith an Ancient) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to ſay, touching God, how can this or that be? it is the genius of ſaith to ſeal to all that God ſaith, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his infallible teſtimony and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60571:18"/>
               <p>There is a double ſtate of man; one of primitive integrity, which God ſet <hi>Adam</hi> in at firſt; another of Apoſtacy, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Adam</hi> fallen. In the firſt there was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, right reaſon; the undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dictate of which is, That nothing can be more juſt, and purely rational, than for our intellect to do homage to its original, and to ſubject it ſelf to infinite truth in all that it ſpeaks to us: ſuch a Reaſon, I am ſure, cannot without loſing its own recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, uſurp a dominion over Divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In the ſecond there is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſpurious, adulterate Reaſon, ſuch as is the black fountain of all hereſies; this is ſo far from being fit to ſit in judgment upon holy myſteries, that it is worthy to be captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and crucified, as being indeed not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the ruſt and corruption of it.</p>
               <p>There is a double furniture of Reaſon, one natural, which ſtands in thoſe common maxims or principles, whoſe truth is invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and at the very firſt ſight apparent to all rational minds; and withal, in thoſe concluſions, which by conſequences and trains of argumentation are duely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly inferred from thoſe principles. Another ſupernatural, which ſtands in the irradiations of the holy Spirit, to make us diſcern ſpiritual things ſpiritually. Take
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60571:18"/>Reaſon with its right natural furniture; ſupernatural myſteries cannot contradict it, no more than one light can oppoſe another; yet they do exceed it, as much as ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light doth natural: Hence it appears, that Reaſon in this ſenſe (being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by ſupernatural myſteries) is a kind of negative meaſure of them, yet (being much exceeded by them) is not, nor indeed can be a poſitive one. Take Reaſon as illuminated by the Holy Spirit, it hath no propenſity or aptitude to ſit in judgment upon holy myſteries; it hath no propenſity to do ſo, becauſe the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lets in ſo much of the ſpiritual glory of them as commands an intellectual ſubjection to them; it hath no aptitude to do ſo, becauſe (the illumination, being but in part) it cannot dive into the bottom of them, or ſee them in their full compaſs and latitude.</p>
               <p>There is a double judgment, one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive or perceptive only; another au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative or dictative. Reaſon in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things may have the firſt, but not the ſecond; it may gather up out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſupernatural notions, but in this it is but a Miniſter or Inſtrument, as <hi>Hagar</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sarah,</hi> it is to wait upon the holy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; if it ſubmit not it ſelf to them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60571:19"/>then (as an Ancient adviſes) <hi>ejice ancillam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Clem. Strom.</note> we are rather to caſt it out, than to loſe the holy myſteries. It is indeed of uſe as it miniſters about them; but if once it grow magiſterial, all will be out of frame; the Divine teſtimony will no longer (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it) go alone or be received for it ſelf; the holy myſteries, how ſublime ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will be drawn down to our model; and as ſeems good to us, they muſt be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries or nullities. Faith, as excellent a grace as it is, will fall out of its orb, and no more give God the glory of his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we will believe myſteries no longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Divine Teſtimony, but ſo far only as they are congruous to Reaſon; that is, in plain terms we will not believe at all: our faith (its ultimate reſolution being not into God and his authority, but into our ſelves and our own reaſon) is a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> would believe only what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſed,<note place="margin">Contr. Fauſt. lib. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> tells them, <hi>Vobis potiùs quam Evangelio creditis,</hi> ye believe your ſelves rather than the Goſpel. This is that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſion which immediately enſues, as ſoon as humane Reaſon gets into the Chair, and falls a judging ſupernatural things: the very Heathen teach us much better Divinity than this, in their fable of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60571:19"/>the Golden Chain, which did not draw down <hi>Jupiter</hi> from Heaven, but attracted men thither. It is not for us to humble and draw down Divine myſteries to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but it becomes us to elevate and lift up our minds in faith unto them.</p>
               <p>The other is this; The proper meaſure and judge of the myſtical union, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; this is the grand Principle of Divine Knowledg; this is the infallible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Faith; here God, who is Truth it ſelf, ſpeaks unto us; here ſupernatural my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are revealed; and in particular that of the myſtical union. Without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who could have apprehended a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity? or, that being known, who could have ſtarted a thought of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical union? or, that being revealed, who could have carried on his thought from thence to the myſtical one? or, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that being manifeſt, who would have preſumed, of his own head, to have expreſſed it in ſuch high and wonderful terms as the holy Scripture hath done? The Doctrine of this Union purely depends on Scripture; there's the holy ballance which weighs it; the Divine Lamp which diſcovers it. If Scripture be ſilent, who can ſpeak? If that ſpeak, who may diſſent? To ſpeak of myſteries unrevealed is a meer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60571:20"/>vanity; to receive them being revealed, is a neceſſary duty.

In ſuper-rational things, Faith ſucceeds in the place of Reaſon, and ſtands upon that infallible Truth, which is a much ſurer foundation than Reaſon can afford.

               <p>To conclude, in all myſteries, and in particular in that of our Union with Chriſt, it becomes us to ſee what the holy Oracle ſaith, and thereupon to ſubject our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings

               <argument>
                  <p>The Scripture uſeth Metaphors to expreſs holy Myſteries by, becauſe the myſteries are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; becauſe it would make us ſeek the things above. It ſets forth the myſtical union by reſemblances. There is an analogy between it and other unions; an excellency in it above them. It ſets forth the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union by that between a King and his Subjects. The myſtical union exceeds in the worthineſs and nearneſs of the perſons united; in the rightneſs of Laws and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; in the intimacy of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the benefits of government; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in protection and rewards.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Myſtical Union being found only in holy Scripture, a diligent ſearch muſt be made there for it. What the Jewiſh Rabbins ſay touching the Law, that I may ſay touching the Goſpel, turn it over, and again turn it over, for all is in it.</p>
               <p>It is the manner of Scripture to ſpeak, not always in proper words, but very often in Tropes and Figures; among others, it commonly makes uſe of Metaphors, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60571:21"/>ſenſe may lead to faith, and earthly things inſinuate heavenly to us. The Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> is an entire Allegory, full of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſteries: other parts of Scripture are, in a great meaſure, like pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras or Tapeſtry, beautified with Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical flowers, and images of Divine things. The reaſon of this is, holy myſteries being <hi>magnalia Dei,</hi> the great things of God, not extracted out of the principles of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, but let down from Heaven out of the Fathers boſom, have a Divine glory and greatneſs in them: No words can perfectly expreſs them; no humane minds can fully comprehend them. Firſt, no words can perfectly expreſs them. <hi>Agur</hi> in very deep humility, ſpeaking of God, asks, <hi>what is his name?</hi> Prov. 30.4. He hath many names; yet, as the Schoolman ſaith, he is <hi>innominabilis ſecundum perfect am expreſſionem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bon. in Sent. lib. <hi>1.</hi> diſt. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> he cannot be named unto perfection; no name made up of finite Letters can perfectly expreſs his infinite perfection. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God,</hi> Joh. 1.1. hath this paſſage, <hi>Forſitan necipſe Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes dixit ut eſt, ſed &amp; ipſe ut potuit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract in Joh.</note> 
                  <hi>quia de Deo ut homo dixit;</hi> perhaps St. <hi>John,</hi> though inſpired, did not fully ſay as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60571:22"/>it is, but as he could; becauſe he but a man ſpoke of God. Chriſt is called the Word (ſaith <hi>Nazianzen</hi>) who is ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to every Word. Holy myſteries are ſo great and glorious, that they are beyond words and expreſſions. Hence the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture uſeth Metaphors, in which names are borrowed from earthly things, and tranſlated to heavenly, becauſe of ſome ſimilitude between them. Again, No humane minds can fully comprehend them; it is but very little we know of God. We proceed (as the Schoolmen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) by way of remotion. Firſt we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him all corporal things; then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him intellectual things as they are in the creature: then it only remains in our minds, that he is, and nothing more. At laſt, we remove from him eſſence it ſelf, as it is in the creature; and then we are in darkneſs. In like manner, it is but very little that we know of holy myſteries; ſomewhat we apprehend, but we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them not; ſome glimmerings of them we have, but we ſee them not <hi>in rotâ,</hi> in their full compaſs and latitude. Hence the holy Spirit in Scripture ſtoops and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates it ſelf to our capacity; and in Metaphors, ſhadows and paints out to us heavenly things by earthly. Divine objects,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60571:22"/>as high as they are in themſelves, are brought down to ſenſe, and ſeen in an earthly image. Our Saviour (ſetting forth the work of Grace by a new birth, and the holy Spirit the author of it by the wind) afterwards adds, <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not; how ſhall ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> Joh. 3.12. That is, if you underſtand not theſe Divine things in their outward images and reſemblances, how will you open your eyes upon them in their pure ſpiritual glory? Spiritual objects, being repreſented under ſenſible, are much better attempered unto our minds, than they would be, if ſet forth in a more proper dialect only. Moreover, Metaphors are of excellent uſe to make us ſeek after the things above; did our minds indeed, take in and digeſt the ſacred ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes in Scripture, the very objects of ſenſe would prompt us to be heavenly; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, being but the ſhadows, would lead us to the true ſubſtance. The Sun would tell us, that there is a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one above which ſhines with healing under his wings. The Wind would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us, that the beſt Gales come from the holy Spirit. The Fountains would mind us, that there is a Well of water which ſprings up into life everlaſting. The old creation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60571:23"/>would be a gloſs and paraphraſe upon the new; every where we ſhould meet with Chriſt and holy myſteries. The duct and tendency of theſe holy Metaphors is ſuch, that a due improvement of them muſt needs render our minds very ſpiritual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
               <p>In particular, The Holy Ghoſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſets forth the myſtical union by many reſemblances: Chriſt (ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) unites us to him,<note place="margin">In <hi>1</hi> Cor. hom. <hi>8.</hi>

                  </gap>, by many patterns; and then he goes on, he is the head, we the body; he the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we the building; he the vine, we the branches; he the husband, we the ſpouſe; he the ſhepherd, we the ſheep; he the way, we the walkers; we are the temple, he the inhabitant; he is the firſt-born, we bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; he the heir, we coheirs; he the life, we the livers; he the reſurrection, we the raiſed; he the light, we the inlightned; and after all, he concludes thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all theſe things declare uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. My firſt work ſhall be to conſider the chief reſemblances, by which this union is ſet forth in Scripture. Certain it is, that the holy Ghoſt uſes no Metaphors or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in Scripture, but ſuch as have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and fitneſs to manifeſt the myſteries thereby ſhadowed out to us: he is ſo wiſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60571:23"/>that he knows what forms of ſpeech are moſt adapted to promote our knowledg of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things; and ſo good, that he will in no forms but ſuch, declare his mind unto us.</p>
               <p>Touching theſe reſemblances, I ſhall firſt note two things in common to them all.</p>
               <p>There is an Analogy between the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union and the other unions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it.</p>
               <p>There is an excellency in the myſtical union above all the other.</p>
               <p>There is firſt an Analogy between them; ſomewhat in the earthly unions reſembles the myſtical one; ſomewhat in the myſtical union anſwers to the earthly pattern; there is a correſpondence between them. This muſt needs be ſo; becauſe in all Scriptural Metaphors touching this or any other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, the Holy Ghoſt always ſpeaks aptly. and truly. When there is no propriety in the words, there is an aptitude in the things to ſhadow out the myſtery; when there is no truth in the proper ſenſe, there is a truth in the metaphorical one, becauſe of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude which is between the earthly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and the heavenly myſtery. If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, that the internal work of grace is a new birth, or a reſurrection, or a new creation, it is ſure, that there is ſome act
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60571:24"/>of power which makes good the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; if it ſay, that Chriſt is to believers a king, or an husband, or a foundation, or a root, or an head, or ſpiritual meat and drink; it is ſure, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of law, or love, or ſupportance, or vital influence, or intimate conjunction which makes good the Analogy. Two things may be noted touching the Analogy; the one is this, there is a neceſſity of it, otherwiſe the holy Spirit in ſuch Metaphors ſhould not ſpeak aptly or truly: not aptly; there being no proper aptitude in the very words, the aptitude muſt be in the things or no where; take away the Analogy, and there will be no aptitude at all, the words (which cannot befall ſo wiſe a ſpeaker as the holy Ghoſt is) will be inſignificant and to no purpoſe: nor yet truly; there being no truth in the proper ſenſe, the truth muſt be in a metaphorical one or no where. Take away the Analogy (which makes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor a Metaphor) and there will be no truth at all; the words (which cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall ſo true a ſpeaker as the Holy Ghoſt is) will be falſe and deluſive. For inſtance, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> Joh. 6.48. <hi>I am the door of the ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.7. The firſt words are apt and true, becauſe by him believers are ſpiritually
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60571:24"/>nouriſhed to life. The ſecond are ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by him believers go in and find pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of comfort; but take away theſe things in which the ſimilitude conſiſts, and the words will not be apt or true. The other is this; there is a very good uſe of the Analogy to be made; it ſerves (being duly and regularly taken according to the line and level of Scripture) not only for illuſtration, but for very good proof alſo. For inſtance, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth the union of Chriſtians among themſelves, by the union of the members in the natural body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And from thence he argues ſtrongly, that Chriſtians ſhould not differ and deſpiſe, but accord and have a care one of another: the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you; if one member ſuffer, all the members ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with it; if one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it. Alſo the Apoſtle ſets forth the Union of Believers with Chriſt, by the union of the members with the head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. And from thence he argues ſtrongly, that Believers have a near conjunction with Chriſt, and admirable communications from him; there are joints and bands; there is a body fitly joyned and compacted; there
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60571:25"/>is nouriſhment miniſtred; there is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual working in the meaſure of every part; there is an increaſing with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God; all theſe are rationally drawn from the Analogy. Thus we ſee, the Analogy is of uſe, not only for illuſtration, but for proof; only we muſt by no means ſtretch it beyond the ſcope of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, There is an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the myſtical union, above all, and every one of the other unions which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it. It is more excellent than any one of them ſingly taken. The Holy Ghoſt doth not ſhadow it out by one or two reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, but by many; and thoſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances do not all point it out in one or two reſpects, but in more and various ones: if one reſemblance or reſpect might have reach'd it, there would have been no uſe or need of any more. It is alſo more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all of them put together; they are but ſhadows and reſemblances, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union is the truth and ſubſtance of them all; in them meer creatures, and thoſe upon earth are united together; in this Believers are united to him who is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In ſome of them there is union with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vital influence; in this there is union with it: in others of them there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, but it is only of a natural life,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60571:25"/>and that only while a local conjunction between the things united is maintained: But in this there is an influence of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Divine life; and this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the local diſtance between Chriſt and Believers be as vaſt, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth: In them there is nothing but plain Law, or Love, or Art, or Nature; but in this there is a ſecret, a myſtery of grace, an admirable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Believers to Chriſt, and by him to the Father. I conclude with the excellent words of <hi>Zanchy,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Union between Chriſt and Believers is ſet forth by that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a King and his Subject. In govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60571:26"/>the humane inſtinct is gratified in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and a multitude is reduced to unity; a King and his Subjects become politically one; he protects them, they are under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; he governs them, they are in ſubjection to him; protection (as the Lawyers ſpeak) draws ſubjection, and ſubjection draws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. His royal care over them is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their reverence towards him; and their reverence towards him falls down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves in the benefits of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">Ar. Eth. lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> he is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the keeper of right for them, and they render him the honour due to his greatneſs: Thus they are knit together for that common good which is the great center of Government. In like manner Chriſt is King, and Believers are his Subjects. His Kingdom, as it imports power, is over all creatures; but as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports union, it is only over Believers. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants (ſaith the Philoſopher) rule over men againſt their wills, but Kings rule over the willing. The Emperor <hi>Juſtinus</hi> plainly told the great oppreſſors,<note place="margin">Spondan. Ann. Anno. <hi>568.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ego contumacibus imperare nolo,</hi> I will not rule over the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. Our Lord Chriſt doth not own rebellious ſinners, while ſuch, as Subjects, but look upon them as enemies: Believers only are his Subjects; he is their great Protector, they are under the wings of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60571:26"/>his grace and power; he rules and governs them, they are obedient to him; his care is over them, their obedience is towards him; he maintains their right, they render him the honour of his government: Thus they are knit together to promote the glory of Chriſt, and the ſalvation of Believers. It's true, in this reſemblance, the meer Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy proves no more than a political Union; but the excellency of that union (which is between the ſpiritual King and Believers) ſhews forth a myſtery. For the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, I ſhall lay down ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The more worthy and near in blood the perſons united in government are, the more excellent is the union. <hi>David</hi> was an excellent one, worth Ten thouſand others; thoſe over whom he reigned were Gods own peculiar people: the nearneſs was ſuch, that the people told him, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, we are thy bone and thy fleſh,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.1. In theſe circumſtances the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>David</hi> and his people could not but be a very excellent one; much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is that between Chriſt and his Subjects, what an one is He! how admirably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for government! he is higher than the Kings of the earth; it was not a little material oyl, but the Holy Ghoſt, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60571:27"/>anointed him to his office. His wiſdom is incomparable, no ſecret is hid from his eyes; <hi>Solomon</hi>'s large heart was but a little thing to the vaſt treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg in him. His Wiſdom is as much above a meer mans, as the Fathers boſom, from whence he came, is above mans heart. His power is exceeding great, he can do every thing; earthly Princes ſet upon their thrones here below, he ſits above at the right hand of Power. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over an Hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces; but he hath all the power in Heaven and Earth. None is ſo able to ſave to the uttermoſt as he; his goodneſs and mercy are beyond parallel. His Divine bowels were up very early in a deſign of grace towards fallen man; his humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions far tranſcend all thoſe in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nay, further, he himſelf would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer being tempted, that he might have an experimental fitneſs to ſuccour the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His clemency is ſuch, that he is very tender over thoſe infirm ones, who are as the bruiſed reed, and have grace in deſire only. His juſtice is very illuſtrious, he reigns in righteouſneſs, he doth nothing but what is right; truth may as ſoon lie, and rectitude it ſelf decline, as there can be any blot or jeofail in his goverment.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60571:27"/>Such a King is Chriſt: And what are his Subjects? They are no common people, but excellent ones; their pure heart hath a kind of Oracle in it; the ſecret of the Lord is with them; they are wiſe in the greateſt concernments, ſtrong in the hardeſt duties; their hearts are melted in acts of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man; their hands are ever doing that which is juſt and right; and the reaſon of all is, becauſe ſome of the holy unction which anointed their Lord, falls down upon them, and puts a glory on them. Such are the Subjects. And what is the nearneſs between the King and them? On the one hand he, though the Son of God, came down from Heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came partaker of fleſh and blood with them; on the the other, they, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally but the ſons of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came through grace, the ſeed of Chriſt himſelf: his blood runs in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; his Divine Spirit breathes in them; his holy image appears in their hearts and lives; the Subjects are all Sons, and reſemble their Governor: Here is not a ſingle relation, but one relation upon another: this is the nearneſs. The reſult is this, he being ſo incomparable a King, they being ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Subjects, the nearneſs between them being ſo great, the union muſt needs be a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60571:28"/>very choice one. Who would now live under the power of ſin, and not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther join himſelf to the bleſſed kingdom? A better Ruler or Society then, there cannot be found.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The more right the Laws and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of a Kingdom are, the better is the Union. There are two ſorts of Laws, there are Laws of conſtitution according to which a King is made; if he be in by election or ſucceſſion, he ſtands upon ſome poſitive Law, or conſent which amounts to a Law; if he be in by conqueſt in a juſt War, he ſtands upon the Law of Nature, which ſaith, that the captive muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the victor. There are alſo Laws of Adminiſtration according to which a King is to Govern his Subjects; without the firſt Laws, there can be no King rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to have Subjects united to him; a people may be under a Tyrant, but it is not united to him. Without the ſecond Laws there will be no rule of government, no right adminiſtration of things in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. According to this diſtinction, I ſhall lay down two things touching the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Kingdom of Chriſt: The one is this, The Law of conſtitution muſt needs be very righteous, as being no leſs than the Decree and Ordinance of God himſelf; he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60571:28"/>was made a King immediately by God; his Kingdom was not (as ordinary ones in part are) an human creature; but a pure Theocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, altogether of Divine Ordination. <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion,</hi> ſaith God of Chriſt, Pſal. 2.6. I have done it, not man. The Decree of Heaven was for it, as the next <hi>verſe</hi> tells us. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> that is the Father ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>ſit thou at my right hand,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere hîc eſt diſcernere,</hi> To ſay here, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That Chriſt ſhould ſit in Royal ſtate and Majeſty; he is a King meerly of Divine Ordination; yet he enters upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Conqueſt; in the <hi>Belial</hi> heart of fallen man nothing is in a fit poſture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this holy King. <hi>The carnal mind is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> ſtrong holds muſt be caſt down, thoughts muſt be captivated, and wills muſt be overcome, or elſe Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a Kingdom: Therefore he takes up his ſpiritual arms, goes forth in the power of his ſpirit and word, and ſubdues the minds and hearts of men to himſelf; ſo he enters by conqueſt, and that in a very juſt, nay merciful war, it being to reſcue poor captive creatures, and reduce them back again to their Creator; but though he come in by conqueſt, yet there is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60571:29"/>populi,</hi> his people are willing, they own him as their King, ſubject to his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and give up themſelves to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Thus he hath a Title to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as good as a Divine ordination, a juſt conqueſt, and a free conſent can make it.</p>
               <p>The other is this, the Law of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is righteous and gracious; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in that which he commands his ſubjects to do; gracious in that which he promiſes to do for them. His Commands (which call for faith, humility, holineſs, righti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, meekneſs, mercy, temperance, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience) are as right as any thing can be, they are the counterpanes of Gods heart, the copies of that Divine Will which is Rectitude it ſelf; they perfect the humane nature, and being practically embraced, they ſet man in a true poſture towards God, himſelf, and his fellow creatures. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (in which he engages himſelf that the Believer ſhall be juſtified, that the poor in ſpirit ſhall have the kingdom; that the pure in heart ſhall ſee God; that the righteous ſhall be compaſſed with Divine favour; that the meek ſhall be beautified with ſalvation; that the merciful ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy; that all his obedient ſubjects ſhall enter into Heaven and enjoy the bleſſed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60571:29"/>God there) are exceeding gracious and true, not one of them ſhall fail; he hath will and power enough to make them all good; this is the Adminiſtration. The ſum of all is, Chriſt being a King by Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, entring by juſt conqueſt, obtaining a free conſent, and adminiſtring his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo admirably, that nothing is in his government but meer rectitude and grace; the union between him and his ſubjects bound together by ſuch right and good Laws muſt needs be very excellent. Here can be no reaſon to complain, no colour of occaſion to break off from ſuch a King, or to ſay, What portion have we in <hi>David?</hi> Here are no ſcruples about the Governors Title, no unjuſt Laws to be repealed, no grievous burdens to be removed, no heavy yokes to be taken off, not the leaſt ſhadow of a male-adminiſtration to be found; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here to be ſeen but rectitude and goodneſs, which muſt needs make the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very firm and ſtable.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The more intimate the union is, and the more internal the bonds of it are, the more excellent is the union. Between an earthly King and his Subjects the bonds are external; there are outward thrones and ſcepters, outward pieces of ſtate and majeſty, outward laws and proclamations;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60571:30"/>the King looking on his Subjects, may ſee the outward man, but no further: He may exact an outward conformity, but cannot touch or move their hearts; there is not one ſpirit between him and them, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, which may eaſily run apart and in different ways. But between Chriſt and his Subjects the bonds are internal; his kingdom comes not with obſervation or outward ſplendor, but in inward power and efficacy; his Kingdom is within, his Throne is in the heart; his Laws are not only without in the Letter, but inwardly ingraven in the hearts of his Subjects; they are the very Epiſtles of Chriſt, <hi>written not with ink, but with the ſpirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tables of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3. Beſides the outward literal Edition of the Law, there is an inward ſpiritual one which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers thereunto; this ſpiritual King can not only look into the hearts of his Subjects, but touch and move them unto obedience; he can ſo draw as to make them run after him; it is his Royal Prerogative to rule wills and hearts; his Subjects have the mind of their Lord; nay, the ſame holy Spirit which is in him, is in them alſo, to inſpire a meaſure of holineſs and obedience into them. O! what a union is here! and how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60571:30"/>full of myſtery! No King can rule after this ſort; neither could he himſelf, unleſs he were God, do ſo: In a word, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Laws being within, his Subjects having the ſame mind and ſpirit with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the union muſt needs be very intimate and excellent.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> The greater the benefits of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are, the more ſecure is the union; a King reſembling God in the doing of good, acting like one given to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a common bleſſing; his vigilancy ſecuring the repoſe of his Subjects; his care procuring their quiet; his ſtudy being for their good as his own; his Subjects reſting under his ſhadow, and enjoying the ſweet ends of a well-ordered Government; the union in ſuch a caſe muſt needs be very much confirmed. I ſhall inſtance but in two benefits of Government, Protection and Rewards: As for Protection, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in the Kingdom of Chriſt; no earthly Kings have ſuch a foreſight and care to protect as he hath; they may look here and there, but his eyes are every where, running to and fro through the earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong on the behalf of his people; they may ſometimes nod with the rains of Government in their hands, and ſo not provide againſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60571:31"/>dangers; but he is never ſurprized, but always provided, and at hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his people; in every temptation he makes a way to eſcape; in every danger he knows a method of deliverance. Again, No earthly Kings have ſuch a power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect as he hath; they have a power in their own Dominions; but he hath all the power in Heaven and Earth in order to the good and preſervation of his people. They and their Subjects joining together, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways able to maintain themſelves and their union againſt a foreign power; but he is always able to maintain his Kingdom. The <hi>Chaldean</hi> Empire was left to the <hi>Perſian;</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> to the <hi>Grecian;</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> to the <hi>Roman;</hi> but his Kingdom ſhall not be left to other people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. but by a peculiar priviledg it abides for ever: no foreign power can ruine it; no gates of Hell can prevail againſt it; the poſture of Chriſt and the Church doth evidence this, Chriſt is at the right hand of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. And the Church is at the right hand of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.9. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture power cannot be wanting, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection fail. Further, As touching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, his bounty is beyond all parallel: Other Kings may ſometimes forget the good ſervices of their Subjects; <hi>Joaſh</hi> forgot the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60571:31"/>kindneſs of <hi>Jehoiada;</hi> the poor wiſe man, who by his wiſdom delivered the City, was not at all remembred, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15. Many excellent ſervices have been buried in oblivion, but the Lord Chriſt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the ſervices of his people; their ſins are delivered over to oblivion, but not their ſervices; no, not the leaſt of them. He hath a bottle for their tears, a book of remembrance for their holy thoughts, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for a cup of cold water given for his names ſake; nay, he is ſo far from forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſervices, that in the very act they find a ſecret reward given in to them; the ſupplies of his ſpirit, the irradiating beams of his love, and the ſweet calms and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in conſcience tell them, that he hath them always in remembrance. Earthly Kings may give their ſervants ſome of the ſhadows here below, and ſome of thoſe things which lye round about them; but he gives his Subjects <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſubſtance, ſound wiſdom, durable riches, and real happineſs; he gives them himſelf, and all that train of good things which accompanies him. Here he gives them tokens and glimpſes of his love; but what great and glorious things are there for them in Heaven? There their labours end in eternal reſt; their holy race arrives at a Crown of Glory; their Prayers
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60571:32"/>are turned into <hi>Hallelujahs;</hi> their Alms are repaid in everlaſting Love; their good works ſhall have a full reward; what they ſowed to the Spirit, ſhall come up in a crop of glorious immortality; in Heaven they ſhall enter into the joy of their Lord, and ſit down with him in his throne; they ſhall then ſee and enjoy the bleſſed God, reading all truths in the original, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good at the fountain-head; dwelling in a paradiſe of bliſs, and for ever repoſing themſelves in the boſom of infinite ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which are prepared for them. To conclude, If Protection and Rewards can do any thing, the Union between Chriſt and his Subjects muſt needs be very ſecure.</p>

                  <p>The Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal one. There is a mutual conſent between Chriſt and believers. The believers conſent imports a right knowledg, a free choice and a preſent compliance with Chriſt. Chriſts conſent is purely gratuitous; believers purely ſupernatural. Chriſt and believers mutually make over themſelves each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Emphaſis of that phraſe <hi>(one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)</hi> opened. There is an intimate love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and believers: he put on an humane nature for them, they put off a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature for him. He died for expiation, they die in mortification. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of good things from Chriſt to the Church; the Church propagates in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and good works. The myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by that of a foundation and a building. Chriſt laid, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers built on him by Divine Art. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cement of faith and the holy Spirit. Chriſt is a large and ſtrong foundation; he bears up the Church by Divine influences.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Union between a King and his Subjects being in the earthly pattern political only; the Holy Ghoſt goes on in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60571:33"/>Scripture to ſet forth the myſtical union by that which is between Man and Wife. Marriage is the conjunction of man and woman in a conjugal ſociety; it is the firſt primordial ſociety, called <hi>Elementum mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> the Element of the world; out of it ſpring Families, out of theſe are made Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Kingdoms; in theſe a Church is raiſed up unto God. The conjugal union is that which peoples the World, and Saints the Church: in no earthly ſociety is there a conjunction ſo great as this is. <hi>Eve,</hi> the firſt Wife, was taken out of <hi>Adam;</hi> he was created one, then two were made out of one; and again thoſe two were one in marriage. Man and Wife (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) are <hi>prima copula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De bono conj. <hi>c. 1.</hi>
                  </note> the firſt bond or tye of humane ſociety. By this conjugal union, the Scripture ſhadows out the myſtical one. The Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> is not (as ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ones have fancied) a light Love-ſong, but an excellent <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or Divine Ditty; which under the parable of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, points out that incomparable union which is between Chriſt and the Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5th Chapter to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> exhorts Wives to be ſubject to their Husbands, as the Church is to Chriſt; and Husbands to love their Wives, as Chriſt loves the Church; and at laſt, he adds,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60571:33"/>
                  <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Church,</hi> verſ. 32. In the original it is, <gap reason="foreign">

They two ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> verſ. 31. yet he looks back to Chriſt and the Church; the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marriage was but the ſhadow and image of the myſtery; but Chriſt and the Church in the myſtical union joined together, are the very center and ſubſtance of it. In this reſemblance, divers things may be noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Marriage, which though found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature, is a voluntary act; there muſt be a conſent; the conjunction of Bruits is like themſelves, out of an <hi>impetus</hi> of nature; but the conjunction of Man and Woman is, as becomes rational creatures, out of counſel and choice; a conſent is neceſſary; Marriage is a contract, and that cannot be without a conſent; he that wants reaſon, which is the root of liberty, cannot conſent. If there be <hi>error perſonae,</hi> a miſtake of the perſon, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>errantis voluntas nulla eſt,</hi> he that errs, conſents not; if there be <hi>metus gravis ac violentus,</hi> a weighty and violent fear
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60571:34"/>extorting a conſent, the conſent not being free is as none at all: In all ſuch caſes, the Rule is, <hi>

Carnis.</note> Chriſt hath carried the earneſt of our fleſh to Heaven, and from thence ſent down the earneſt of his Spirit to us; the conſent is mutual: on Chriſts part there is a conſent, though it be to eſpouſe not Angels but men; not men in their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beauty and integrity, but men under a ſtain of ſin and corruption; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to it, and that not out of error or miſtake, but out of choice and tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent love, which as early as eternity it ſelf delighted in the ſons of men, and in time calls and draws them into conjunction with himſelf: all the ſweet wooings, pathetical expoſtulations, precious promiſes, and free offers in the Goſpel, are as ſo many ſure teſtimonies given to his conſent. On the Believers part there is alſo a conſent; they breathe after him, reſt upon him, reſign to him, and accept of him upon the terms of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60571:34"/>the Goſpel: In their conſent two or three things may be noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There muſt be a right knowledg of Chriſt; to an unknown Chriſt there can be no conſent; the knowledg of him muſt be right in the meaſure of it. Under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> where Religion was much wrapt up in vails and ſhadows, a leſs mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledg might ſuffice; but under the <hi>New,</hi> when men live in the noon-day light, and as it were directly under the Sun of righteouſneſs, a much greater meaſure of knowledg is neceſſary. We ſhould now ſtudy to know him diſtinctly in his offices and benefits, that we may aptly, and out of judgment join our ſelves to him. If a man think, that Chriſt is a Saviour only and not a Lord; or that one may partake of Chriſt crucified, and yet not take up his Croſs in mortifications and patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, nor yet follow him in holineſs and true obedience, here is <hi>error perſonae,</hi> ſuch an one knows not the true Chriſt, but a Chriſt of his own fancy; his conſent, which is proportioned to his knowledg, is not to the real Chriſt, but to the imaginary one: no man can conſent to more than he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands; the knowledg muſt be right, that the conſent may be ſo. Again, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg muſt be right in the nature of it, it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60571:35"/>muſt not be a meer notion, which may be in an heart like <hi>Nabals,</hi> dead and cold in ſpiritual things; but it muſt be a ſpiritual knowledg, which diſcerns Chriſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and carries with it ſuch a ſavour of him, as makes the heart chuſe and embrace him above all things. Further, As there muſt be a right knowledg, ſo there muſt be a free choice of Chriſt. <hi>Conſenſio volentis eſt,</hi> conſent is in the willing; it is not a thing preſſed out of the heart by fear, but ſweetly iſſuing out of it in a free option. When <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France</hi> was preſſed under the fears of death, he ſent for the holy Hermite, holy Oyl, holy Croſs, and what not in his extremity. Many men, when upon their death-beds they are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from this world and entring upon eternity; or, poſſibly before that laſt hour, when the wrath of God flaſhes into their conſciences, and ſets them a fire with the dread of what is juſtly due to their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may in ſuch a ſtrait ſeem very willing to have Chriſt: But alas! all this is but a force, a meer preſſure upon their wills. Nothing like unto that pure genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which is in true Believers, who chuſe and ſet their hearts upon Chriſt, as ſeeing the excellency of his Perſon, uſefulneſs of his Offices, rectitude of his Precepts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60571:35"/>of his Promiſes, and greatneſs of his Rewards; the intimate biaſs and bent of their hearts is ſuch, that leaving the world behind their back, they embrace and fall in with their dear Jeſus above all things.</p>
               <p>Moreover, This conſent is a preſent actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al one; in Marriage there are words uſed, not <hi>de futuro,</hi> but <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> or elſe it is no Marriage, but a promiſe only. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do not ſay as the ſluggard, yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber in ſin; nor as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his delays before converſion did, <hi>modo ecce modo;</hi> but they give a preſent conſent to Chriſt; when he knocks, they ſay not, go and come again to morrow (for that is not to conſent to day, nay, not to conſent at all, but only to ſpeak of it) but they make haſte and delay not, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately they open and own him as their Lord; he is their greateſt deſire, and they will not put him off, no, not for a world, which is much leſs in their eyes than he is: They have to their great ſhame too long ſerved their corruptions, now they join themſelves unto him in a perpetual cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant never to be forgotten; without any more ado a preſent actual conſent is given to him. It is indeed ſaid by Divines, that the true deſires of Grace are Grace; and ſo they are: but then thoſe deſires do at
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60571:36"/>leaſt virtually and ſeminally contain in them a preſent conſent; for where thoſe deſires are in truth, there the heart breaks off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with ſin, and values Chriſt as its chief treaſure. Were ſuch an one asked, what he would have in the firſt place; he would anſwer, None but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Before I paſs over the conſent between Chriſt and Believers, two things may be noted touching the excellency of it above that which is between man and wife.</p>
               <p>The one is this; Chriſts conſent is a pure gratuitous act. When a man chuſes a wife, the reaſon is in the object, ſhe is fair, or virtuous, or rich in eſtate, one attractive or other draws out his conſent; but when Chriſt made his choice, no attractive was in his Spouſe; Believers, no leſs than others, are naturally void of holy Graces, and ſo extreamly poor, that they have not of their own to cover their nakedneſs, or pay their debts; there was nothing in them to draw out his love towards them; the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his choice was in his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Grace had no other mover but it ſelf. It's true, he ſaith of his Church, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art fair, my love: behold, thou art fair,</hi> Cant. 1.15. But, as our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Engliſh Annotator ſpeaks, <hi>Locutio ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi infuſio doni,</hi> to call her fair is to make
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60571:36"/>her ſo; her beauty was not a jewel of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a love-token given from him. Therefore in the next <hi>verſe</hi> the Church breaks out, <hi>Behold, thou art fair my beloved;</hi> ſhe gives back all to him, her beauty was but the reflection of his; ſhe ſhines not of her ſelf, but <hi>radiis mariti,</hi> with the beams of her Husband; and to him may ſay, I am <hi>Japha,</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>Japhe;</hi> I am fair becauſe thou art ſo. Indeed he eſpouſed her upon a deſign of grace, to change her <hi>Ethiopian</hi> skin, and put a Divine beauty upon her. Thus his conſent was meerly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous.</p>
               <p>The other is this; The Believers conſent is purely ſupernatural. Wives conſent to their Husbands out of principles of nature; but Believers conſent to Chriſt out of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of grace. They are born, not of blood, of humane ſeed; not of the will of the fleſh, of carnal concupiſcence; not of the will of man, of the heroical acts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtue; but of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. His Holy Word is the Seed, his Divine Love the Mover, he himſelf the Generator of them; their faith, which is their conſent, is not of themſelves, but the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. No ordinary wooing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their conſent, Chriſt doth not, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Suitors do, woo outwardly only, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60571:37"/>he ſpeaks to the heart; and that, not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Shechem</hi> did to <hi>Dinah,</hi> in kind words; but, as God did to <hi>Lydia,</hi> in the inward operation of his ſpirit, which opens the heart, and from thence draws out a conſent. In the fall of man all the faculties fell, and among the reſt the believing faculty fell alſo; and, as it lies in the ruines, it cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the elevations of ſupernatural grace lift up it ſelf and give a conſent to Chriſt: he is a ſupernatural object, and a conſent to him muſt be from a ſupernatural principle, no leſs than an heavenly <hi>ſuada</hi> can draw it out towards him.</p>
               <p>Again, In Marriage Man and Wife do by conſent paſs over themſelves each to other; hence the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.4. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of bodies between them, <hi>in re ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciali;</hi> no one hath a plenary right; each one hath a right in the other. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the ſpiritual marriage, Chriſt and Believers do by conſent paſs over themſelves each to other: Hence the Church ſaith, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2.16. each one of them hath a communion and propriety in the other. Chriſt gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Believers; his atoning blood is his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60571:37"/>own, yet they may waſh in it; his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is his own, yet are they raiſed up, and made to ſit together in heavenly places in him; his interceſſion is his own in the glory and excellency of it, yet is it theirs for their ſingular uſe and benefit.</p>
               <p>Again, Believers give themſelves to Chriſt; their minds are devoted to his holy light; their wills are reſigned to his ſacred will; their pious poſture tells the world, That they are not their own, but his; to give him all is their duty; to keep back the leaſt part from him is no leſs than ſacriledg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all is conſecrated to him. Thus in both the Marriages there is a giving of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each to other; yet ſtill there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency on the ſpiritual ſide: Man and Wife make over themſelves mutually, ſo as to become one fleſh; but Chriſt and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers make over themſelves mutually, ſo as to become one ſpirit. It is the Apoſtles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>He that is joined to an harlot is one body; for two (ſaith he) ſhall be one fleſh: But he that is joined unto the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.16, 17. A communion of bodies is a great thing; but what is it to that union which is between Chriſt and his Church, in which there is one and the ſame ſpirit in both? Man and Wife, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever united in love, have two different
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60571:38"/>ſouls; but in Chriſt and Believers there is but one ſpirit. I know ſome Divines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this one ſpirit to be only this, That there is one temper in Chriſt and Believers; but this, though a very great truth, is not the all, or full Emphaſis of the Text. When the Scripture tells us, that the mind of Chriſt is in us, it may be fairly interpreted of one temper; but when it tells us of one ſpirit, it muſt needs import ſomething more high and myſterious. To make this appear, the circumſtances of the Text muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; the Apoſtle in this place dehorts them from fornication, not only becauſe it is a ſin againſt our own bodies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. but from three other reaſons: Firſt, our bodies are the members of Chriſt, and ſhall we make them the members of an Harlot? <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. Then we are joined, and one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with Chriſt; and ſhall we be joined and one fleſh with an Harlot, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, and 17? Laſtly, our bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; and ſhall we profane that Temple by finning againſt it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, and 19? Here it is to be noted, That theſe three Reaſons are fundamentally but this one, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have the Spirit of Chriſt in us; this Spirit makes us Members; this Spirit being in us, we are one Spirit with Chriſt; this Spirit hath a Temple in us;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60571:38"/>therefore upon the account of this Spirit we ſhould fly fornication. It is alſo to be noted, that theſe Reaſons, which are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally one, do depend upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the firſt is confirmed by the ſecond, and the ſecond is explained by the third; that we are members of Chriſt, is clearly confirmed in that we are one ſpirit with him; and that we are one ſpirit with him, is excellently explained in that we are the Temples of the Spirit; all three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hang together, and make one great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt Fornication. This being the ſcope and order of the place, the phraſe <hi>(one ſpirit)</hi> muſt be conſtrued in ſuch a way as may ſute to the antecedents and conſequents; as to the antecedents, it muſt import that ſpirit which makes us members of Chriſt; as to the conſequents, it muſt import that ſpirit which hath a temple in us; either way it muſt needs be meant of the holy Spirit. It is that which makes us members of Chriſt: <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Non poteſt vivere corpus Chriſti niſi de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu Chriſti,</hi>

                  </note> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, The Body of Chriſt cannot live but by the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> That is no member which hath not the ſame ſpirit with the head. Alſo it is that which hath a Temple in us; <hi>Deus Templum

                  <hi>If the Holy Spirit were not God, he ſhould not have us for his Temple:</hi> it being (as he there urges) no leſs than Sacriledg and an <hi>Anathema</hi> to make a Temple to a creature. Not then the holy temper which is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Holy Spirit who is God, hath a Temple in us. Thus the order and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of things plainly teach us the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>(one Spirit)</hi> to be, that the ſame Holy Spirit is in Chriſt and Believers: Nay, omitting the dependance, the words themſelves ſhew the ſame thing. <hi>One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is here immediately oppoſed to <hi>one fleſh;</hi> when a man and woman become one fleſh, there is more than a likeneſs of temper; there are many alike in carnal propenſions, who yet were never ſo joined as to be one fleſh; and if one fleſh ſpeak more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like temper, much more doth one ſpirit do ſo: I take it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one ſpirit, is as high a phraſe as can be to expreſs an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate union. I conclude therefore, That the Apoſtle doth not meerly intend a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper, but that the ſame Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in Chriſt and Believers, which indeed is a very high and glorious myſtery.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60571:40"/>
               <p>Further, Marriage is a ſtate of Love, and Love hath an unitive virtue in it; a true friend is <hi>alter ipſe,</hi> another ſelf; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of love between two friends, there is, as it were, but one ſoul in both.<note place="margin">Confeſs. Lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaith, That his friend being dead, he did but <hi>dimidius vivere,</hi> live but like half a man. If there be ſuch love between friends, how much more is it ſo between man and wife? Between them there are the ſtricteſt bonds, and higheſt degrees of friendſhip. <hi>A man ſhall leave father and mother, and ſhall be joined to his wife,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.31. In the original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he ſhall be glued to his wife. Conjugal love is the glue, which takes hold on both ſides, and joins them together as if they were but one piece; and therefore the Apoſtle there adds, <hi>they two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> And a little before he tells them, <hi>He that loveth his wife, loveth himſelf, verſ.</hi> 28. She is an <hi>alter Ego,</hi> a piece of himſelf; and not to love her is as unnatural as to hate his own fleſh; the near relation which is between man and wife, calls for a mutual and more than ordinary love.</p>
               <p>The Parallel is the intimate love which is between Chriſt and Believers; he loves them as parts and pieces of himſelf, they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60571:41"/>love him as their deareſt head and husband; he loves not their graces only, but their perſons; they love not his gifts only, but himſelf. Ordinances are his Banqueting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Graces are his Love-tokens; but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the great center of their love: He is raviſhed, nay, excordiated with their ſingle eye of faith and chain of obedience, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. they are raviſhed in him who is <hi>totus deſideria,</hi> all or wholly deſires; his perſon, natures, offices, life, death, reſurrection, interceſſion, every thing in him is amiable in their eyes; his love to them is ſuch, that he eats his honey-comb with his honey, wax and all, accepting their ſervices not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the infirmities cleaving to them; their love to him is ſuch, that, though ſometimes they ſleep and nod in humane frailty, yet their heart waketh; the inward bent and motion of it is to him, the leaſt call or knock will make them riſe and ſeek after him: There is an intimate love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them; but how far this exceeds that which is between man and wife, the tongue of men and Angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully utter. I ſhall only touch on one or two things.</p>
               <p>On the one hand Chriſt took an humane nature that he might eſpouſe us to himſelf; to him, as meer God, ſinful creatures could
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60571:41"/>not be joined, his pure Majeſty could not admit them to approach to him; but that he might have a Spouſe among men, he left his Fathers boſome and came down into an humane nature; Majeſty was put under a vail of fleſh, and through that we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him. It would be a very ſtrange thing, for a glorious Angel to come down into the rank of worms, and eſpouſe matter; much more admirable is it, that the very Son of God (one infinitely more above an humane nature than an Angel is above mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) did come down into our frail fleſh, upon deſign to eſpouſe us to himſelf: never did love ſo ſtoop and condeſcend as here. On the other hand Believers are content, as much as may be, to put off their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, that they may be joined to him; he put on a pure humane nature for them, they put off a corrupt one for him; at his call they leave their own people and their Fathers Houſe, I mean, the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were born or bred in; nothing is dearer or nearer to faln man than his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fleſh, and thoſe luſts which are the members of it; yet they part with it and them for Chriſt: Their Motto is, <hi>Chriſtus meus eſt omnia,</hi> my Chriſt is my All.</p>
               <p>Again, On the one hand, Chriſt died in our nature that he might eſpouſe us. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60571:42"/>ſerved for a Wife, <hi>David</hi> fought for one; but none but our dear Lord died up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs for us: our match with him could not be diſpatched without atoning blood. A type of this we have in that firſt Marriage between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve; Eve</hi> was taken out of the ſide of fleeping <hi>Adam;</hi> the Church is taken out of the ſide of a dying Chriſt. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was taken out of the ſide of man, to ſignifie the marriage of the ſupreme bleſſed man: While <hi>Adam</hi> was ſleeping, a rib was taken out of him and made into a woman; when Chriſt died on the Croſs, there came out of his pierced ſide blood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in theſe we have the original of the Church, which riſes up out of expiation and regeneration, to be a Spouſe to him. On the other hand, Believers in the power, and after the pattern of a crucified Chriſt, dye to themſelves and the world; his pure fleſh ſuffered in a way of expiation; their corrupt fleſh ſuffers in a way of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by his Croſs the world is crucified to them, and they to the world; his body was nailed to the Croſs, and there they hang up their luſts to dye and expire: Thus there is a tranſcendent love between him and them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, In Marriage two things more may be noted:</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60571:42"/>
               <p>The one is this, There is a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good things from the Husband to the Wife. It is an old ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all things are common among friends; much more is it ſo among married perſons, a communion of bodies draws a communion of other things with it: the near relation between man and wife calls for it; his neceſſaries ſerve to ſupply her, his honour puts a luſtre upon her, his riches are ſeen in her Jewels and attire: If <hi>Adam</hi> had a world, <hi>Eve</hi> did participate with him. Thus it is in the earthly marriage; much more is it ſo in the ſpiritual one; When ſuch an one as Chriſt is joined to Believers, what, and how great muſt the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be? The earthly Husband according to his ſtate and degree doth communicate to his Wife; what then doth Chriſt, who hath a Deity and unfearchable riches in him, communicate to thoſe who are in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with him? Want they cannot while he hath a Deity; or be without a ſupply, till his riches be exhauſted: They go no longer in the rags of their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but are covered with the robe of his pure righteouſneſs; guilt can no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide on them, becauſe they are ſprinkled with his aroning blood: while he hath an Holy Spirit they cannot want the Jewels
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60571:43"/>and ornaments of Grace; their love, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obedience, patience, ſhew that he hath put ſome of his beauty upon them; his wine-cellar of Scriptures and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtands open to them, that they may taſte and drink of Divine Conſolations; at laſt they ſhall enter into the palace of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there partake of his glory: No Husband but himſelf can ſo communicate.</p>
               <p>The other is this, That in Marriage there is a due propagation of mankind; indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals dye, but mankind is preſerved; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſupplies what death devours. Alſo in the ſpiritual marriage there is a double propagation; one of Believers, another of good works: Firſt in the Church there is a propagation of Believers; ſuch an one as Chriſt could not but have a ſeed, his name was to be continued as long as the Sun, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.17. In the original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his name ſhall be ſonned or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſucceſſion of Believers. The Church at firſt was in a Believer or two; but being Chriſts Spouſe, ſhe becomes Mother of thouſands, a ſpiritual <hi>Eve</hi> to bring forth Sons unto God. In the power of the Word and Spirit (which are as the ſeed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative virtue in this heavenly generation) multitudes of Believers come forth as the dew from the womb of the morning, not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60571:43"/>in the Jewiſh Church only, but in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile world alſo; the wilderneſs buds and bloſſoms, the barren ſing for joy, the tent is enlarged, the curtains are ſtretched forth, the Church breaks out on the right hand and on the left in an admirable fertility; this is the fruit of this Divine Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church. Again, In particular Believers there is a propagation of good works; as we are in conjunction with <hi>Adam</hi> we are impotent and barren; but as ſoon as we are in conjunction with Chriſt we have power and holy fruits. To open this, it will be worth while to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the words of the Apoſtle: <hi>Ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead to the law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſins which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter,</hi> Rom. 7.4, 5, 6. Here we have two ſorts of perſons, the unregenerate who are in the fleſh of corrupt nature, and the regenerate who have a new ſpirit or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in them. Two ſorts of Marriage,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60571:44"/>one unto the Law in the unregenerate; and another unto Chriſt in the regenerate. Two ſorts of fruit, one unto death in ſinful actions; another unto God in good works. The unregenerate are married to the Law, they are under the curſe of it as ſinners; they have but the naked letter of it, which commands, but helps not: Nay, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is accidentally irritated by it; their inward malignity ſwells and riſes againſt the holy commands which ſtand in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſo many dams and bars to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous luſts: Hence they bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fruit unto death; what they ſeem to do in Gods ſervice, they do only in the oldneſs of the letter, in the external work, without a ſpirit or principle for it. The regenerate are dead to the Law, and married to Chriſt; they are not under the curſe of the Law, but pardoned in Chriſt; they have not the meer outward letter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the quickning ſpirit; they are not irritated by the command, but delight in it as in their joy and treaſure: Hence they bring forth fruit unto God; they ſerve him in newneſs of ſpirit, in the ſuavity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal holy principles; their good works are not brought forth in bondage and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, but by a free ſpirit, and in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the new creature. We ſee here,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60571:44"/>that the progeny of good works iſſues not out of nature or the letter of the Law, but out of a conjunction and ſpiritual marriage with Chriſt, who by his Holy Spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Believers to bear holy fruits.</p>
               <p>The conjugal union in the earthly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern not being enough, the Holy Ghoſt goes on to ſet forth the myſtical union by that which is between the foundation and the building. Chriſt in Scripture is called a <hi>foundation</hi> upon a double account; he is the foundation of Doctrine, <hi>Other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11. Here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of a foundation of Doctrine; the conſequent words make this appear: the gold, ſilver and precious ſtones are pure and ſolid Doctrines; the wood, hay and ſtubble are vain and frivolous ones; both are called mans work which the fire ſhall try. He is alſo the foundation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; They <hi>are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being the chief corner ſtone,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20. It's true, the Apoſtles and Prophets are here called a foundation; but they are only a doctrinal foundation, Chriſt is the perſonal one; they are a foundation metonymically only, Chriſt is ſo properly: upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets is no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60571:45"/>other than upon Chriſt, whom they in their Preaching laid as the foundation of the Church. The Foundation and the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone are both one and the ſame Chriſt; as a Foundation he bears up and ſuſtains the Church; as a Corner-ſtone he joins and holds together the two walls of it made up of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this reſemblance three or four things may be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The Foundation and the Building are both framed by Art. Firſt, the pattern is in the mind of the Builder, and then the thing is ſet up. In the Spiritual Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Building the Art was not humane but Divine; the <hi>Idea</hi> of them was not in mans mind but in Gods; man, falling off from his bottom of primitive integrity, could not have a foundation in himſelf, God in infinite wiſdom contrived that he might have one in another; the way was admirable, the eternal Word was made fleſh; two natures met in one perſon; an humane, in which he obeyed and ſuffered for us; and a Divine, which put an infinite value upon his obedience and ſufferings; in theſe, full ſatisfaction was made for ſin, a purchaſe of grace and glory was obtained for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, an incomparable pattern of ſanctity and obedience is ſet before us, and an Holy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60571:45"/>Spirit is provided to quicken us to imitate him: Mercy runs freely in the channel of the Promiſes; Proclamations of Grace are made unto men. Here's the Foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which fallen man may be built up unto righteouſneſs and life eternal. Oh, riches of Wiſdom! wonder of Love! It's true, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and carnal men, while ſuch, are no more fit among perſons, than hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are among Doctrines, to be built upon this Foundation; but the ſame Wiſdom which laid the Foundation, will build the Houſe; the Holy Spirit is ſent forth to work faith in men, and thereby to frame them to be ſet upon the Foundation: hence the Apoſtle ſaith, that the whole Building is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fitly framed together, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.21. each part of the Building is aptly and congruouſly united to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and to the other parts of it; the Building anſwers to the Foundation, and both to the <hi>Idea</hi> in the infinite Mind. To contrive theſe, was one of the greateſt thoughts that ever entred into Gods heart; and to effect them, was one of the greateſt works which ever was done in time.</p>
               <p>Between the Foundation and Building there is ſomewhat that joins and cements them together; between Chriſt and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the cement is not material but ſpiritual;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60571:46"/>theſe are joined together by Faith and by the Holy Spirit. Faith is one cement: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-ſtone, elect, precious: he that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. Faith joins the Believer to the Foundation; that's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he ſhall not be confounded. Sin, Satan, the World, ſhall not confound him, becauſe he is built upon a Foundation, in which is Propitiation, Grace and Victory; the Divine Favour, the influences of Grace, the Crown of eternal Life ſhall not fail him, becauſe he is joined to a Foundation, in which the Promiſes of theſe things are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Spirit is another cement. <hi>In whom,</hi> that is, in Chriſt the Foundation, <hi>you are builded together for an habitation of God through the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.22. The earthly Foundation and Building are joined together by dead matter like themſelves;<note place="margin">Chriſtus, ſive lapis ſit in aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio, ſive radix in arbore, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve vitis in viveâ, ſive caput in corpore, ſemper eſt non ſolum vivens, ſed vita vivificans. <hi>Zanch.</hi> in loc.</note> but Chriſt who is a living Foundation, and Believers who are lively ſtones, are united together by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; this is a great myſtery; the ſame Holy Spirit which is in him, is in them alſo.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60571:46"/>
               <p>Again, The Foundation ſupports and bears up the Building; in like manner Chriſt ſupports and bears up the Church, the whole weight of it lies upon him; without him all the ſpiritual ſtones would inſtantly ſink, and totter down into a chaos of emptineſs and confuſion: To make the excellency of this ſupportation appear, we muſt conſider firſt what manner of Foundation he is; and then in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he bears up the Church.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, He is a Foundation able and every way compleat to ſupport and bear up the Church; a ſhort ſcanty Foundation cannot do its office; but he is an ample large one, multitudes of Believers in all ages have been built upon him, and yet there is room for more. Did all the men in the world build upon him by Faith, he would bear them all up to life eternal; a weak faultring Foundation cannot do its office; but he is a ſtrong one, a Rock which cannot fail. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> made that glorious confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the ſon of the living God;</hi> our Saviour anſwers him, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,</hi> Matt. 16.18. The Rock here is not confeſſing-<hi>Peter,</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt; our Saviour ſaith not, thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon thee; but <hi>thou art Peter,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60571:47"/>and upon this rock I will build my Church. Peter</hi> is not the Rock, but built upon it. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Tract. <hi>124.</hi> in Joh.</note> 
                  <hi>Non a Petro petra, ſed Petrus a petrâ, ſicut non Chriſtus a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano, ſed Chriſtianus a Chriſto vocatur;</hi> the Rock is not named from <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> from the Rock; as Chriſt is not named from the Chriſtian, but the Chriſtian from Chriſt.

                  </gap>, the Rock, upon which they are built; they being Stones may be moved, but he being a Rock is unmovable and for ever the ſame. <hi>Peter</hi> fell greatly; had he been the Foundation, the whole Church muſt have fell with him; had not Chriſt been a Rock to him, his fall would have been final. Theſe words (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon this Rock) note that one individual Foundation, upon which the whole Church is ſo built, that <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> To be ſuch a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none is capable but Chriſt only; it is not to be imagined, either that the whole Church ſhould be built upon a meer man; or if it could, that being ſo weakly founded, it ſhould ſtand againſt the powers of darkneſs. Chriſt the true Rock is not a meer man, but the Son of the living God; he hath the ſtrength of a Deity which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail. Earthly Foundations may be eat
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60571:47"/>up by time, or ruined by violence; but he is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a founded foundation, or a foundation of foundations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. No time can deface the eternal One, no violence ſet its foot upon the Almighty; he abideth ever to ſupport his Church.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond, The ſupportation of the Church is in a ſpiritual way; it is bore up, not as an earthly building by dead matter, but as a ſpiritual Houſe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace; <hi>To whom coming as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God and precious: Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built a ſpiritual Houſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. He is a Living Foundation, one who hath an endleſs life of merit, and the Spirit of life above meaſure. Hence Believers, who are built upon, and as it were parts of him, are maintained in life; his Spirit by continual influences and ſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace bears them up in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual being and life; the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt them.</p>

                  <p>The Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſet forth by the Vine and the Branches. Chriſt hath one nature with Believers; they are as branches in him, and receive juice from him. The myſtical union ſet forth by the natural head and the body. Thoſe two famous Texts, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 16. Col. 2.19.</hi> conſidered, which import more than when Chriſt is called Head over all things, Head of principality and power, Head of every man, Head of the Heathen, or Head of the Church as an Husband. Chriſt as an Head hath the ſame nature with Believers; but exceeds them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as being firſt and higheſt; in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being full of Grace; in virtue, as influencing into the Church. The neceſſity, matter, and way of this influence. Chriſt an Head above all other heads, as making of no member a member; and as having virtue enough for a world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Union between the Foundation and the Building in the earthly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern importing only a ſupport, but no vital influence; the Holy Ghoſt goes on to ſet forth the myſtical union by that which is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60571:48"/>between the Vine and the Branches. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. In the former Chapter he told them of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away; here he comforts them againſt it, his departure ſhould be no ſeparation, ſtill he would be cloſely united to them as the Vine is to the Branches. He is a Vine, one whoſe ſhadow reaches to the ends of the earth, whoſe precious blood cheereth the heart of God and man; I mean, it ſatisfies juſtice, and quiets conſcience. Believers are Branches in him, not native ones, but inſititions, taken off from the old ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> and implanted into Chriſt. Hence they are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into him, ſo as to have juice from him. The union between him and them is ſo intimate, that they abide in him by Faith, and he abides in them by his Spirit; the effect of this union is fruitfulneſs. Though the ſeeming Branches mentioned <hi>verſe</hi> 2. are but <hi>pampinarii,</hi> ſuch as have leaves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet the real ones are always <hi>fructuarii,</hi> ſuch as have holy fruit. In this reſemblance ſome things are to be obſerved:</p>
               <p>The Vine and the Branches have one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo have Chriſt and Believers; he took
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60571:49"/>an humane nature, that he might be a Vine to us, and we Branches in him; that he might communicate ſpiritual ſap unto us, and in vertue of it we might bring forth fruit unto God. The <hi>Arrians</hi> of old argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this place againſt the Deity of Chriſt; The Vine (ſaid they) is of the ſame nature with the branches, but not of the ſame nature with the Husbandman; Chriſt is conſubſtantial with us who are the Branches, but not with the Father who is the Husbandman. To which I anſwer, this parable of the Vine proves Chriſts Deity as well as his humanity; he muſt be, not a meer man, but God-man in one perſon, elſe he could not be ſuch a Vine as he is here deſcribed to be. Were he only God, he could not be an homogeneal Vine, and have one nature with us; were he only man, he could not be an influxive Vine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſpiritual life unto us, it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſphear of a meer creature to do it: Were he (as the <hi>Arrians</hi> would have him) no more than ſo, all the Branches in him would be dry and withered, no ſap of Grace or ſpiritual Life would be found among men. It's true, the earthly Vine hath not the ſame nature with the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, but the ſpiritual one hath it; here the Husbandman is the root of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60571:49"/>Vine it ſelf; here the Vine calls the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman Father, <hi>My Father</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is the Husbandman;</hi> this Vine in eternity ſprung out of the Fathers boſom, and in time ſprung out of the Virgins womb; ſo he is conſubſtantial with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to his Divinity, and conſubſtantial with us as to his humanity.</p>
               <p>The Branches are in the Vine, ſo are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of every Branch, <hi>Si in vite non est, in igne erit;</hi>

                  </note> that the union between Chriſt and Believers is ſuch, that he communicates life to them, but receives it not from them;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60571:50"/>they receive life from him, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it not to him: We have here a great myſtery, Believers are ingrafted into Chriſt, and in a ſort parts of him; hence the very ſame Spirit which is in him, is derived to them, to make them bear good fruit.</p>
               <p>The union between the Vine and the Branches importing a vital influence, but in a low negative life, the Holy Ghoſt goes on to ſet forth the myſtical union by that which is between the natural head and the body; we have two excellent Texts for this. Chriſt is an head, <hi>From whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by that which every joynt ſupplieth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the effectual working in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelf in love,</hi> Epheſ. 4.16. Again, he is an Head, <hi>from which all the body by joints and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with the increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19. Here Chriſt is the head, and Believers the body; here the body is fitly joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and compacted; there is in all the members a congruity and a cloſe conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Head, and unto one another; here are joints and bands, the primary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature is the Holy Spirit, which makes Chriſt and Believers to be as it were continuous,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60571:51"/>and to touch one another. Under the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are the bonds of Faith and Love; Faith unites and incorporates Believers into Chriſt; Love glues and cements them one to another; here's an effectual working in the meaſure of every part; the holy Spirit ſtirs up the principles of Grace in Believers, the principles of Grace ſtir up the Soul, the Soul in the virtue of thoſe principles ſtirs up it ſelf, all is ſet into motion from Chriſt the Head. Laſtly, Here's an edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body, an increaſing with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God; Believers grow up into Chriſt in all things, their Faith is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, their Love is more inflamed, their union with Chriſt becomes cloſer, their likeneſs to him grows more lively than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; in every part of the new creature there is a Divine increaſe, and all is becauſe they are united to the Head: Between Chriſt and Believers there is an apt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate union made by excellent joints and bands; through theſe bands there comes to be an effectual working in Believers; by this working there iſſues forth an increaſe of all holy graces. O what an Head is Chriſt! how happy are Believers who are in conjunction with him! the excellency of this union is much beyond what can be ſaid or thought of it; it is not for us to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60571:51"/>dive into the bottom of it, or to ſee it in the full compaſs: Nevertheleſs, that we may know ſomewhat of it, it is worth while to compare the headſhip of Chriſt in theſe two excellent Texts, with his Headſhip in other Scriptures; he is Head over all things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. He is Head of all principality and power, that is, of Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. He is Head of every man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. He is Head of the Heathen, reigning as a King over them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.43. He is Head of the Church, as the Husband is head of the Wife, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. But his Headſhip in thoſe two famous places imports much more than the other headſhips.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is head over all things to the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. That is, the Churches Head hath a power over all things. <hi>God hath highly exalted him,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. In the original there is an emphatical Pleonaſm, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him above all exaltation, lifted him up above all altitude; hence Chriſt hath a name above every name, he ſits at the right hand of Power and Majeſty; all creatures in Heaven, in Earth, under the Earth, that is Angels, Men, Devils, all muſt bow the knee to him, every tongue muſt confeſs him to be Lord; all things are put under him, not only the lower world as it was to

                  <hi>Adam,</hi> but all the Creation, Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are the top of it, not excepted; he hath all the power in Heaven and Earth, thus he is head over all things: But we muſt obſerve here, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that he is head unto all things, but <hi>head over all things,</hi> which denotes only power, not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither doth he ſimply ſay, that he is head over all things, but that he is <hi>head over all things to the Church;</hi> which imports, that though he be Lord over all, yet he is a proper peculiar head to the Church; he is united to it as to his body, not ſo to all things; though all things be reduced to him as an head of power over them, yet all things are not his body; he is united to the Church by joints and bands, not ſo to all things; he communicates his own ſpirit to the Church, not ſo to all things; he is head over all things, that he might be a complete allſufficient head to the Church; his univerſal power makes him meet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and preſerve the Church which is his body and chief care; all things are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in a ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the Churches good.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is head of all principality and power, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. That is, he is an head of eminency and power over the Holy Angels; he is <hi>made ſo much better than the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60571:52"/>Angels, as he hath by inheritance a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name than they,</hi> Heb. 1.4. Unto which of the Angels ſaid God the Father at any time, Thou art my Son, or ſit thou at my right hand, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and 13? Angels are Sons by creation, but Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the proper Son of the Father; not as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made out of nullity, but a proper Son begotten out of his ſubſtance. Angels, as Courtiers of Heaven ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, but he ſits at his right hand in ſtate and majeſty; Angels and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers being made ſubject unto him: But to Believers he is an head of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and influence; the Church made up of them is his body, homogeneal and of one nature with him, joined to him by the bands of Faith and a regenerating Spirit, and ſupplied from him with ſpiritual life and motion; thus it is not with Angels.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſome worthy Divines hold, That from Chriſt God-man, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the holy Angels, not only of illumination and accidental joy (which may be eaſily granted), but of confirming and eſtabliſhing grace: He is (ſay they) a Mediator to them, though not of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reconciliation, yet of preſervation and confirmation in their holy eſtate. The Apoſtle ſaith, that God doth <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The diſtinction between a Mediator of Redemption, and a Mediator of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation only, is not, I think, to be found in Scripture; we read of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, not of a Mediator between God and Angels; <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> Gal. 3.20. but of more than one, and thoſe not in amity, as God and Angels are; but at variance, as God and fallen man are. A Mediator (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports) is a middle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon interpoſing between parties at variance; but God and holy Angels are not at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all, that any ſhould interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: It is congruous, that a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould partake of the ſame nature with thoſe for whom he mediates, the one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and man, is the man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. The ſubſtantial mediation muſt precede the actual one; he that is <hi>medium reconciliationis,</hi> muſt be firſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60571:53"/>
                  <hi>medium participationis;</hi> he muſt partake of our nature, that he may mediate for us. Hence it appears, that Chriſt not aſſuming the nature of Angels, hath not a fit nature, in which he may mediate for them; neither indeed do they want a Mediator. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency wanted none, much leſs do the holy Angels, much higher in perfections than he, ſtand in need of one: It's true, the Apoſtle ſaith, that God in Chriſt doth gather together and reconcile all things in Heaven and Earth; but the <hi>(all things)</hi> in the Text are to be limited to men only; the things in Heaven are the Spirits of juſt men there, not the holy Angels; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were never ſcattered, cannot be gathered; and becauſe they never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot be reconciled: but if the things in Heaven ſhould reach to Angels, it would not from thence follow, that Chriſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates for Angels; but that he ſo mediates for men, that the Angels, who before ſtood off and at a diſtance from men, are reconciled and at amity with them.</p>

And a little after, he calls them Children, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Thoſe who are ſanctified by Chriſt, have one and the ſame nature with him, and upon that account, are his Brethren and Children; Angels not being ſuch, are not ſanctified by him; but men being, ſuch have a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60571:55"/>influence from him.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock I will build my Church,</hi> Matt. 16.18. God purchaſed the Church with his own blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.

               <p>Thus it appears, That Chriſt is an Head of eminency over Angels, but of influence unto men. The very Text (which proves him head of Angels) demonſtrates this, ye are <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Chriſt is head of every man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Not to ſtraiten the words, but to take them in their full latitude, he is head, not of Believers only, but of all men; he is an head of eminency to them; never was the humane nature ſo exalted and lifted up as in him, in whom it is united to the Deity, and filled with all grace; he is an head of authority over them; he is Law-giver and Judge of the world; nay, in ſome ſort he is an head of influence to them; he is that light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, that is, with the light of Reaſon, which is the Candle of the Lord; in the firſt lighting of it up, it was a piece of nature coming from Chriſt as God; in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60571:56"/>the continuance of it in fallen man, it is a reprieved thing, owing to the ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſacrifice of Chriſt as God-man and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; ſin being an univerſal forfeiture, not only of the outward bleſſings in the world, but of the inward furniture in the ſoul; it is through the Mediator, that the world ſtands unturned into a Chaos, and that reaſon continues not extinct and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly gone out; we are bound to thank Chriſt, that our forfeited Reaſon is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from us. In this ſenſe Chriſt is an head of influence to every man; but unto Believers he is an head in a more excellent way, influencing unto them, not nature or reaſon only, but his own Spirit and Grace, to raiſe them up above nature, and mould them into his own likeneſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is head of the Heathen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.43. That is, he reigns as a King over the Church of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> his kingdom is a ſpiritual one: he doth not, as other Princes, rule meerly by outward Laws, but he inſpires obedience into his Subjects, and by a vital influence inclines them to do his will; yet the myſtical union is not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, when in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> he is called the head of the Heathen, as when in the Apoſtle he is called the head of the body; there he is called an head, <hi>ex analogiâ regis
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60571:56"/>in regno,</hi> by a reſemblance drawn from a King in a Kingdom; here he is called an head, <hi>ex analogiâ capitis in corpore naturali,</hi> by a reſemblance drawn from an head in a natural body; there the earthly pattern im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only a political union, here it ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows out a myſtical one; as importing a vital influence, which the other pattern doth not.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is head of the Church, as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the head of the wife, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. He is ſuch an Husband as never was; the earthly Husband and Spouſe are one fleſh, but Chriſt and Believers are one Spirit, there is a vital influence between them; yet the myſtical union is not ſo fully expreſſed, by ſaying, that Chriſt is the head of the Spouſe, as by ſaying, that he is the head of the Body; there he is called head by a reſemblance drawn from the Husband and Wife; here he is called head by a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance drawn from an Head and a natural Body; there the earthly pattern imports chiefly a moral union, here it ſhadows out a myſtical one, as importing a vital influence which the other pattern doth not.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the headſhip of Chriſt comparatively taken.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conſider it abſolutely in it

In an Head two things may be noted, <hi>ratio convenientiae &amp; ratio differentiae,</hi> there is ſomewhat in which the Head agrees with the Members, ſomewhat in which the head exceeds them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is ſomewhat in which the head agrees with the members, the head hath the ſame nature with them; Chriſt hath the ſame nature with Believers; he, though the eternal word, took an humane nature that he might be an head to them; the Children being partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. that they, in themſelves poor fallen creatures, who could not immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto his Deity, might through the vail of his fleſh come and be joined to him as their head; that from the fountain of his Deity, all Graces might flow through his humanity, as through a channel unto them: Here is admirable encouragement for their Faith; the glorious Son of God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60571:57"/>came down into their fleſh, that they might join themſelves to him, and receive Divine influences from him. Again, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in which the head exceeds them; the Schoolmen place this exceſs in three things, <hi>in ordine, in perfectione, in virtute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>3.</hi> pars Queſt. <hi>8.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in perfection, in virtue. The head is in order the firſt and higheſt part; Chriſt even in his humane nature is firſt in dignity, and higher than all men; he is in nearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Deity than all creatures are; creatures of life are nearer to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than thoſe of meer being; creatures of ſenſe are nearer to it than thoſe of life; intellectual creatures are nearer to it than thoſe of ſenſe only; but the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt is nearer to it than all the reſt, as being hypoſtatically united to it; we are predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Chriſt is the firſt-born, firſt in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and prerogative; his image is the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type and grand ſampler according to which all Believers are formed and faſhioned in holineſs; the graces of all Saints, as well thoſe before his incarnation, as thoſe after it, carry a reſpect to him as the firſt and chiefeſt of all.</p>
               <p>The head excels in perfection, all the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60571:58"/>ſenſes are in it; Chriſt is an head of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he is full of Grace, not as the Saints are, in a meaſure only; but in an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſuperlative way; in them there is <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo vaſis,</hi> the fulneſs of a Veſſel, but in him there is <hi>plenitudo fontis,</hi> the fulneſs of a Fountain; they have ſome feathers of the Dove, ſome firſt-fruits of the Spirit, but he hath the Dove it ſelf, the whole entire Spirit in all the graces of it; the Spirit was not given to him <gap reason="foreign">

He hath all Graces; extenſively, all kinds of Grace; nothing, that imports perfection, is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; intenſively, all degrees of Grace, the higheſt top of holineſs is no where to be found but in him; Grace is in him, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in the Ocean, or light in the Sun, in an abundant and indeficient manner; he is the great Element or primary ſubject of Grace, ſo that in all the intellectual world it is no where to be found in that fulneſs as in him; his humane nature hath as much Grace as it can hold, its capacity is filled up to the brim, at leaſt in reference to Gods ordinary power; nay, ſome of the Schoolmen go higher, and ſay, that its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is ſo filled up, that if God ſhould
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60571:58"/>put forth his abſolute power to the utmoſt, he could not poſſibly pour into the Soul of Chriſt one drop of Grace more than it hath already; not out of any defect in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, but for want of room in the capacity of the Soul to receive it. But to wave this, it is enough for us to ſpeak as the Scripture doth, <hi>It pleaſed the father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. Chriſt hath all fulneſs of Grace, he hath grace in the greateſt extent as to all the kinds of it, and in the greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency as to all the degrees of it; he hath whatever appertains to Grace, and hath it, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">

               <p>It was requiſite that Chriſt our head ſhould have ſuch a fulneſs of Grace; the nearer a creature is to the influent cauſe, the more abundant is the influx; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt was moſt nearly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Deity; therefore it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, that it ſhould have grace in the ſupream degree. From the firſt inſtant of his incarnation he was not a meer <hi>viator,</hi> but a <hi>comprehenſor;</hi> he always enjoyed the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60571:59"/>beatifical viſion, therefore all his Graces were <hi>in termino,</hi> and at a full point. It's true, that by ſpecial diſpenſation there was ſome reſtraint of the influence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the time of his Paſſion, but his graces were ſtill in the higheſt degree. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Grace was conferred upon Chriſt, not as a private perſon, but as a publick one; not for himſelf only, but for us; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts for men, that he might give them out to them; he was to be the head of the Church, a vital and univerſal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace to it; therefore no leſs than a plenitude of Grace was requiſite to make him meet for it, that of his fulneſs we all might receive Grace for Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. Grace anſwering to the Grace in him.</p>
               <p>The Head excels in virtue, it influences into the whole body. Chriſt is an head of incomparable virtue, he influences into the whole Church, even into that part of it which was before his incarnation, as well as into that which was after it. <hi>Ab Abel juſto</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>uſ<expan>

               <p>Touching this influence from Chriſt the Head, I ſhall conſider three things, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an influencing head, the matter of the influence, and the way how it comes from Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60571:60"/>
               <p>The firſt thing is the neceſſity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing head, I mean not a ſimple neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but an hypothetical one. God was not bound to raiſe up a Church out of the corrupt maſs of mankind; but upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal that he will do ſo, it was requiſite that there ſhould be an influencing head. In our firſt head <hi>Adam,</hi> there was once a ſtock of holineſs and righteouſneſs, not meerly for himſelf, but for us; but in the fall he ſpent it, and became an utter bankrupt. Had he ſtood in his integrity, holineſs had come along with nature unto us; but through his Apoſtacy nothing comes along with it but pravity and corruption; we are now void of Grace and full of Sin. And how ſhould there be a Church? which way ſhould fallen man arrive at inherent Grace? Nature cannot aſcend above its level, or lift up it ſelf to ſuch a thing as Grace, which is <hi>altioris ordinis,</hi> of a rank and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der above nature. God doth not treat with fallen man immediately, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Grace to him, but in and through a Mediator; it was therefore meet that the Son of God ſhould in our fleſh interpoſe, and become an head of influence to us, that ſo grace might be communicated; nay, and continued to us. It could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated but through a mediating head,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60571:60"/>and he is a compleat one; it could not be continued without a perpetual ſupply, and he is not as <hi>Adam</hi> a failing Head, but an everliving one; his ſatisfaction and merit have an endleſs life in them; the holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon him is indeficient, and ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down upon Believers; hence the anointing, which they receive from him, abideth in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. becauſe there is a continual ſupply from him who hath the Spirit above meaſure; not only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, but the continuance of it requires an influencing Head.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the matter of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, I mean that which by it is derived to us; Chriſt the Head influences a Divine life, ſenſe and motion, into his believing members.</p>
               <p>He influences life into them. As long as they are in old <hi>Adam,</hi> they are dead in ſin; but as ſoon as they are in Chriſt, they live: <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. His ſpiritual life was not from himſelf but from Chriſt the Head, who communicated the Holy Spirit to him, and in that reſpect lived in him; neither was this peculiar to Apoſtles, but common to all Chriſtians; Chriſt is their life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. a Divine virtue from him makes them live; this was typed out in <hi>Eliſha.</hi> No ſooner did
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60571:61"/>the dead man touch his bones, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and ſtood upon his feet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.21. No ſooner do we by Faith touch Chriſt crucified, but there is a vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in us, a ſpirit of life, which diſcovers it ſelf in the pulſe of heavenly affections, and breath of ſpiritual prayer; and is a real proof and demonſtration that. we have a living Head in Heaven, who makes us (in our ſelves but dead lumps of clay and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) partakers of a Divine life.</p>
               <p>Again, he influences ſenſe into them. There are <hi>interna</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, internal ſenſes in them; ſome quickneſs in the fear of the Lord, ſome ſight of the beauty and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Holy Commands, ſome taſts of the Divine Love and Grace, ſome ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt and the Holy Unction, ſome experimental touches of the things above, ſome glimpſes of Heaven and Glory; but all theſe are from the Head, elſe Believers would, as well as others, lie in the ſtupor of the fall, and be no more concerned about heavenly things, than about meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. It's true, a man, not joined to the Head, may have a great notion of theſe things, but he hath no particular ſenſe of them; the current of his affections is ſuch, that, one would think, there were no other world but an outward ſenſible one; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60571:61"/>ſenſations are not from meer notion, but from Chriſt the Head.</p>
               <p>Further, He influences motion into them. Whether they be melting in repentant tears, or burning in acts of holy zeal, or drawing out their ſouls in charity, or ſweating in a lawful calling, or bowing down under an afflicting providence, all the motion is from the Head; without him all their Graces would lye dormant in an habit, and be as it were none at all. It is the Head which awakens them and makes them go forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. The holy action is in Believers, but the ſtrength is in the Head only; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good they do, they muſt thank the Head for it; which not by an outward command only, but by an inward virtuous influence alſo, bids them ariſe and do it.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, the way how the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes from Chriſt unto Believers. We are not to think, that the habits of Grace in Chriſts humane nature are transfuſed into us; habits go not out of their ſubjects into another; they produce acts in their own ſubjects, but procreate not habits in foreign ones. But this is the way: Chriſt being full of all Grace, did by his glorious ſatisfaction and merit, procure, that the ſame Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60571:62"/>which is upon himſelf the Head, ſhould fall down upon Believers the myſtical parts and members of him: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Holy Spirit is ſhed on us richly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. Had not he atoned and merited for us, the Holy Spirit would not have touched upon one fallen Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> but in, and through him, there is, as St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">In Epheſ. cap. <hi>4.</hi> bom. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit flowing from above, which touches every member of his body. After this ſort he is an Head of influence to his Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his Spirit to all his members, to unite them one to another, and all of them to himſelf the Head: <hi>There is one body and one ſpirit,</hi> Epheſ. 4.4. Were there not one Spirit in Believers, they (being as far diſtant from one another in time, as the morning and evening of the world, and in place as the parts and quarters of the earth) could not poſſibly be one body; were not the one Spirit from Chriſt, he could not be an Head of influence to his Church, or carry himſelf to it as his Body; but there being one Spirit in Believers, they are one Body; and that one Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Chriſt, he is an Head of influence to them. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, That he is <hi>head over all things to the Church, which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60571:62"/>is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22, 23. Such an Head is he, as filleth the Body, his Church, with his own Spirit. It's true, the Church is his fulneſs in one reſpect; though he hath all fulneſs in him, and filleth all in all, yet, as he is an Head (which he deigned to be to us) he is not full without a body; but he is the Churches fulneſs in a much higher reſperct; the Church is his outward fulneſs, ſupplying him with members, without which he is not compleat as an Head, but is pleaſed to accoumt himſelf maimed; but he is, as I may ſo ſay, the Churches inward fulneſs, by his own Spirit moving and actuating it as his Body. The Church is his fulneſs in reſpect of integrity of parts, without which he would be as an Head without a Body; but he is the Churches fulneſs in reſpect of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and the ſpirit, without which the Church would not be a living Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him as a living Head. Thus he is an Head of influence to Believers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in a meaſure his own ſpirit to them. Notable is that of <hi>Durandus, Nullus actus vitae eſt in corpore, qui non ſit in capite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Sext. lib. <hi>3.</hi> diſt. <hi>13.</hi> queſt. <hi>1</hi>

                  <hi>nullus actus gratiae eſt in totâ Eccleſiâ, ad quam ſe non extendat gratia Chriſti:</hi> There is no act of life in the Body which is not in the Head; there is no act of Grace in the whole
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60571:63"/>Church, to which the Grace of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is further to be noted, that Chriſt is an Head of incomparable excellency; he is not only Head over all things, but an Head above all other heads; and for this I ſhall inſtance in two things.</p>
               <p>The one is this, The natural head cannot make <hi>membrum de non membro,</hi> a member of that which was none before; but Chriſt, ſuch is his excellent virtue, can draw and gather men off from the old corrupt ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> and tranſplant and incorporate them as members into himſelf the Head: naturally they were loſt, but he ſeeks them; dark, but he inlightens them; dead, but he quickens them; foul, but he waſhes them; black, but he puts a beauty upon them; all the members of him may admire infinite Grace, and ſay, we were not the people of God, but now we are ſo; we were not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, but now we are ſo. In <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt head, all men were ruined; but Chriſt the ſecond Head hath power over all fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. to draw and gather men into union with himſelf; and in ſo doing, to make his Power and Grace illuſtrious.</p>
               <p>The other is this, The natural Head hath virtue enough for its own members; but Chriſt our Head hath virtue enough for a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60571:63"/>world; did all the men on earth by Faith come into union with him, there would be no defect, but a ſupply of grace for them all; his ſatisfaction and merit are of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe value; his Spirit is a fountain of Grace never to be drawn dry or exhauſted; There is in him (as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſpeaks) not only <hi>plenitudo ſufficienciae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Sent. lib. <hi>3.</hi> diſt. <hi>13.</hi> qu. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> a fulneſs of ſufficiency, as in the Saints; but <hi>plenitudo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantiae,</hi> a fulneſs of ſuperabundance; enough to overflow a whole world of men in caſe they were by Faith united to him. Oh! what an Head is Chriſt! there is a famine of Grace in lapſed nature, but in him there are ſtores and treaſures for our ſupply; there is a fulneſs of ſin in us, but in him there is a ſuperabundance of Grace to overcome it; in him we may ſee holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not in the little Pictures of it as in the Saints, but in the great Sampler and Origen thereof. That beautiful thing, Grace, in him appears not in beams and drops, but as in a Sun or Ocean. Happy are thoſe who are in union with him! they live in the ſpring and univerſal principle of Grace; in all the acts of ſpiritual life, ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may feel the Power, Virtue, and Divine Efficacy of him the Head.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The myſtical union ſet forth by that between the food and the body. Chriſt is the trùe food. He strengthens againſt the curſing Law. He ſtrengthens unto all duties. He is united to Believers. He is food by way of eminency. Several concluſions drawn from the reſemblances, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and Believers is not meerly a political one. That it is not meerly a moral one. Several reaſons to prove the ſame. That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion affords ſupport to Believers. That it gives a vital influence to them. That it is a very intimate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That it hath a great myſtery in it. That it is very laſting and durable.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter all theſe reſemblances the Holy Ghoſt yet proceeds on to ſet forth the myſtical union by that which is between the food and the body: This reſemblance we have notably opened in the Sixth chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> where our Saviour, who uſed to ſpiritualize every thing, raiſes up his diſcourſe above earthly food to heavenly; above the typical, to the real <hi>Manna</hi> which is himſelf, who came down from Heaven to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60571:64"/>give life to the world. In this Diſcourſe ſeveral things offer themſelves to us:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Chriſt is the true food of the Soul; The <hi>Jews</hi> dream'd, that at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> they ſhould have a wonderful feaſt of outward varieties; but he tells them, that he himſelf was the feaſt, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, my blood is drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> verſ. 55, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is, though Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, yet truly ſuch; it doth (what meat and drink are to do) nouriſh and ſtrengthen the receiver; nay, it hath not only an analogy to, but an eminency above all corporeal food; it nouriſhes and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens us in the Soul, the nobleſt part of man, and that not for a day, but to all eternity. Hence our Saviour tells them, That they ſhould not labour for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhould give unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. He is the food of the Soul upon a double account.</p>
               <p>The one is this, His fleſh and blood, as crucified and ſatisfactory to Divine juſtice, do ſtrengthen us againſt the curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law. The moral Law is immortalized by its own intrinſecal recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the very frame of mans ſoul puts him under it; his Reaſon cannot but be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60571:65"/>bound to know the ſupreme Truth; his Will cannot but be bound to love the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Goodneſs; the reſpects in his ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers towards the Creator, are a Law not to be altered; as long as God is God, and man man, this Law cannot but be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, one jot or tittle of it cannot fall to the ground. To make it the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and venerable, Divine Juſtice fenced it in with a Threatning, and added a Curſe againſt the tranſgreſſor; <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all the points of it. The wages of ſin is death:</hi> All men being tranſgreſſors, Conſcience, as ſoon as it is awakened, tells a man his own; theſe and theſe things are ſins, thus and thus thou haſt done, the offended Law condemns thee, the wrath threatned hangs over thy head; the conſequent of this is, That the heart is full of inward wounds and terrors, it knows not which way to look or turn it ſelf. Take a ſinful man in theſe circumſtances, where doth his ſtrength lye? what plea or anſwer hath he to the broken Law? How, or which way may the Curſe be avoided, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience eaſed? The only thing can be ſaid, is this, Chriſt was made a Curſe for us; he is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs; he hath made a perfect atonement and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; this is the Believers hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60571:65"/>this is his great plea and anſwer to the charge of the Law. <hi>Oſtendo ſidejuſſorem meum,</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> when the Law makes its demands againſt me, I ſhew my <hi>Sponſor</hi> Chriſt who ſatisfied it. This is lively expreſſed in <hi>Anſelms</hi> direction for the viſitation of the ſick, <hi>Si Dominus te volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit judicare, dic, Domine, mortem Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti objicio inter me &amp; tuum judicium, alitèr tecum non contendo; ſi tibi dixerit, quia peccator es, dic, mortem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni noſtri Jeſu Chriſti pono inter me &amp; pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta mea, ſi dixerii tibi, quod meruiſti damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, dic, Domine; mortem Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti obtendo inter me &amp; mala merita mea, ipſiuſ<expan>

It is not in our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent graces to juſtifie us againſt the Law,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60571:66"/>theſe are not our Chriſt, theſe do not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Law, theſe do not make a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for ſin; no, it is Chriſt only that doth this; his death, which ſatisfied Gods heart, muſt ſatisfie ours; his precious body and blood are the food, which, when fed on by Faith, cheer the Conſcience, and fill it with peace. Hence the Noble <hi>Luther</hi> tells the menacing Law, <hi>O Lex! immergo conſcientiam meam in vulnera, ſanguinem, mortem, reſurrectionem &amp; victoriam Chriſti, praeter hunc nihil planè videre &amp; audire volo;</hi> O Law! I drown my Conſcience in the wounds, blood, death, reſurrection and victory of Chriſt; beſides him will I ſee and hear nothing. This is the true way of peace and holy reſt; the oriency of this Divine Truth is ſuch, that it hath extorted a confeſſion from its enemies. The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men themſelves, as Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> hath obſerved, whatever they are in their <hi>Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets</hi> and comments on the Sentences, yet in their <hi>Soliloquies</hi> and devotional medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions acknowledg <hi>Jehovah juſtitia noſtra.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Contarenus</hi> ſaith, that we muſt; <hi>viti tanquàm re stabili juſtitiâ Chriſti nobis donatâ,</hi> lean on Chriſts righteouſneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us, as on a ſtable thing.

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60571:66"/>
               <p>The other is this, The fleſh and blood of Chriſt, as it is procurative of the Holy Spirit, doth ſtrengthen Believers unto all the duties incumbent on them; the Spirit is from Chriſt as an Head; and it is from him as aliment; his Members have it, and ſo have the feeders on him. Hence in that ſixth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> after a very Divine Diſcourſe touching eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, he adds, <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth,</hi> verſ. 63. The feeders on him have of his Spirit, which ſtrengthens them in the inner man; this ſtrength nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſcovers it ſelf in them; their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how ſtrong ſoever, are ſubdued: The Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt, makes them free from the Law of ſin; Satan that evil one is overcome by them; the Spirit, which is in them, is greater than he that is in the world; they do duties, as becomes them who live at ſo high a rate, in a very lively vigorous manner; the free Spirit ſtabliſhes and enlarges their hearts to run in the pure ways of holineſs and obedience; under croſſes they do not murmur at the hand of God, but in an holy ſilence ſubject to it; the Spirit ſtrengthens them unto all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

Hence <hi>Averroes</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid, That if Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their God, he would not have his ſoul to be with them. It is a wonder to me that thoſe who are called Chriſtians, ſhould hold ſuch an eating! Nay, that men on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60571:67"/>earth ſhould orally eat the body of Chriſt in Heaven, or that his glorified body ſhould come into our earthly mouths and ſtomacks, is to me a thing utterly impoſſible; he is and muſt for ever remain in glory. The eating therefore is a ſpiritual one, done by faith; though Chriſt be in Heaven, faith flies up and apprehends him.<note place="margin">In 1 Cor. 10. Hom. 24.</note> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> would have us be as Eagles, and ſo fly to Heaven; and then adds, <hi>Where the carcaſs is, there will the eagles be.</hi> Chriſt our ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is gone to Heaven, and faith follows after him, to draw life and virtue from him. Faith doth ſpiritually participate of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood, and from thence doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a Divine power and ſtrength into the ſoul. As faith aſcends up, ſo the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes down upon believers, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats the union between him and them: <hi>They dwell in him, and he in them,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks; they dwell in him by faith, and he in them by his Spirit. There is a mutual indwelling, a moſt near and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate union between them. The learned <hi>Grotius</hi> takes this mutual indwelling to be only <hi>amore mutuo,</hi> by a mutual love. <hi>Amans eſt ubi amat, quod hic tribuitur manducati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni, id alibi tribuitur dilectioni,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. The lover is where his love is. What here is attriouted to eating, that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60571:68"/>place is attributed to love, <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> But I take it, there is a difference; our union to Chriſt is firſt and more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, and then in and through him we are united unto God. It's true, God dwells in the ſincere lovers, but he dwells in them as in parts of Chriſt, partakers of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; were they not ſuch, the ſpots of guilt and imperfection upon them would make the holy one wave dwelling in them: Chriſt is united to us as aliment, inlivening and ſtrengthening us; but God is not as ſuch united to us; though the fountain of life and virtue be in him, yet are theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived down unto us in and through Chriſt, of whoſe body and blood we do by faith participate. We are (ſaith Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>) by a myſtical and ſupernatural union as truly conjoined with Chriſt, as the meat and drink is with us, when by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work of nature it is converted into our own ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Chriſt is food by way of eminency: Food above all food; other bread is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but a ſhadow or meer figure; but he is the true bread, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, living bread, which makes men live for ever; other bread comes but out of the earth; but he is that bread which came down
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60571:68"/>from Heaven. The Son, very God, came down into our fleſh, and in it was broken upon a Croſs, that his body and blood might become bread for us. <hi>He hath</hi> (ſaith Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>) <hi>by his death made his fleſh broken,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Incarnat. fol. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>and his blood poured out for us upon the Croſs, to be fit food for the ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of our ſouls, and the very well-ſpring from whence by the power of his Godhead, all life and grace is derived unto us.</hi> Thus that excellent man. Other food being inferior to the body, is changed into our ſubſtance; but Chriſt the ſpiritual food being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more excellent than our ſouls, turns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who feed upon him, into his own likeneſs. Chriſts blood may be read in their ſerene conſciences, his death may be ſeen in their continual mortifications; his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhews it ſelf in their holy graces; as they live at an higher rate, ſo they live in a more divine manner than other men. Their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, meekneſs, love, zeal, obedience, patience, tell us that they live upon him; who turns the eater into himſelf; the eater ſo participates of him, as to be aſſimilated to him.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the reſemblances of the Myſtical union. I ſhall now draw out fome Concluſions from them, becauſe (as is before noted) the Analogy between the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60571:69"/>Myſtical union and the earthly patterns ſerves (if genuinely taken) not only for illuſtration, but for very good proof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The union between Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is not meerly a Political one, ſuch as is between a King and his Subjects. It's true, Chriſt is a King, believers are his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; there are Laws of conſtitution, which make him a King over them, and Laws of adminiſtration, according to which he governs them; yet the union between him and them is not meerly Political. To make this appear, I offer theſe things.</p>
               <p>The manner of his Kingdom is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; were his Kingdom ſuch only as earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones are, there might be ſome colour to ſay, That the union is only Political: <hi>But his Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> Joh. 18.36. It is not <hi>mundanae indolis,</hi> of an earthly, but of an heavenly nature.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſebius,</hi> Hiſt. 13.</note> When the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of our Saviour were asked touching his Kingdom; they anſwered <hi>Domitian,</hi> That it was not Earthly but Coeleſtial. It cometh not in outward pomp and glory, but in inward efficacy. It ſtands not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without in Laws and Ordinances, but it is within in the very hearts and conſciences of men. He makes a willing people, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires obedience into his ſubjects. His own Unction doth in ſome meaſure fall down
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60571:69"/>upon them. Earthly Kings, who yet are Politically unite to their ſubjects, cannot rule after this ſort, or do any thing like it: Hence it is clear, that if there had been no other reſemblance of the union between Chriſt and believers but that of a Kingdom only, yet that union would not have been meerly Political, becauſe his Kingdom is what others are not, ſpiritual and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal efficacy.</p>
               <p>In Scripture our union with Chriſt is not only ſet forth by the reſemblance of a Kingdom, but by many other; none of which are or can be thought to be in vain; all of them have their ſignificancy, and that to different purpoſes. The conjugal union imports love, the architectonical one ſhews ſupportation, that of the Vine and the Head ſpeak vital influence; that of food expreſſes a very intimate conjunction: Theſe fignificancies are not forced, or ſtrained, but natural and genuine, ſuch as run into our minds at the firſt ſight. The holy Scripture, the beſt interpreter of its own reſemblances, aſſures us, that they are uſed to this very end and intent, that we might firmly believe that thoſe things which are genuinely in the outward pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, are really and after an eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Chriſt: He is an Husband for his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60571:70"/>deareſt Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. a foundation for his never failing ſupport to his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. a Vine and an Head for his vital influence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. aliment for his near and intimate conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56. Such is the natural tendency of theſe reſemblances, ſuch is the interpretation of them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but now if our union with Chriſt be meerly Political, how can theſe things ſtand? what tolerable account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of them? It is certain, that nothing in all the lower world is ſo apt and proper to declare that union as meerly Political, as the reſemblance of a Kingdom; nothing is ſo ſignificant and fully expreſſive of it as that; when therefore the Holy Ghoſt had ſet it forth by a Kingdom, why did not he ſtay his hand and reſt in that reſemblance? why would he go on and ſet it forth by the love of Eſpouſals, by a building cemented to its foundation, by the inciſion of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into a root, by the copulation of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to a vital head, by the incorporation of food with the body? What analogy is there in an union meerly Political, to theſe things? Which way ſhall the Scriptural interpretation of them be maintained? a Political union cannot do it. Were our union with Chriſt no more than ſo, theſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60571:70"/>reſemblances would not be apt or true; to ſay that Chriſt is an husband, a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a root, or head, or incorporated food, that is, a Political King, is not apt or true, but very odd and ſtrange; becauſe in Chriſt as a meer Political King, there is nothing that anſwers to the proper genuine import of theſe reſemblances; in ſuch a caſe the Holy Ghoſt (which is blaſphemy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) would ſeem to ſpeak very unfitly, nay, and deluſively, as if he would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that to be in Chriſt, which is indeed not in him; ſurely it becomes us much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conclude, That our union with Chriſt is not meerly Political, but ſuch as bears a fit and juſt correſpondence to all the patterns and reſemblances of it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Such as the bonds of union are, ſuch is the union, a meer Political union hath bonds of the ſame nature, a ſpiritual union hath ſuitable ligatures; in our union with Chriſt the primary bond is the holy ſpirit: <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. in Chriſts Kingdom, it is the Spirit which makes a willing people, ſuch as ſubject themſelves to him. In the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural marriage believers who are joined to Chriſt, become one ſpirit; in the ſpiritual
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60571:71"/>edifice, the living ſtones are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. In the heavenly Vine the Spirit is the juice which makes the branches fruitful in good works; in the Myſtical Head the Spirit is unction which falls down upon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and communicates ſenſe and motion to them. In the divine aliment it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which quickneth the eater, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms him into the holy Image of Chriſt; the Spirit is the primary ligature in our union with him; that union therefore is not meerly Political, but Spiritual.</p>
               <p>A meer Political union is made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by ſome outward Law. Policy is the <hi>Eutaxy</hi> or good order of a common ſociety. Multitudes in government conſpire into unity; the bond of conjunction is Law: Hence the Law is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſoul of a City; without it all the parts and members of the body-politick ſink and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into meer confuſion; but to the making and continuance of our union with Chriſt, internal influences are requiſite. Faith, the great unitive grace, is not produced by a meer propoſal of the object, but by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine efficacy; there muſt be inward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and tractions to make men come and cloſe with Chriſt; in like manner other graces, which make the believer bear the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60571:71"/>image and reſemblance of Chriſt, are by the Spirit drawn and engraven in the heart: Hence they are called the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When theſe graces are produced, they are ſtill but creatures, and depend upon their original; the continual ſpirations of the Spirit bear them up in being: in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects there is a neceſſity of internal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Hence it appears that our union with Chriſt is more than a Political one; were it no more than ſo, the outward Law might have ſufficed; that firſt and rudeſt draught of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> (which made grace to conſiſt only in <hi>libero arbitrio &amp; lege,</hi> in free-will, which is a thing natural, and in the Law which is a thing Political) might have been a truth: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt it, and tells us, that God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in the hearts of men,<note place="margin">De Grat.

As therefore we would avoid this great error, we muſt confeſs that our union with Chriſt is more than a Political one.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The union between Chriſt and Believers is not meerly a Moral one, ſuch as conſiſts in a reciprocal Love, in an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Wills, and confederacy of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Very true it is, that there is a very great Union of Love between Chriſt and Believers: All the Loves and Friendſhips in the world are but Pictures and little Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, being compared with the Love and Friendſhip which is between Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; wonderful is his Love towards them; As early as eternity it ſelf, his eyes and his heart were upon them; he aſſumed fleſh to eſpouſe them to himſelf; he ſhed his Blood to purchaſe them; he dyed on a Croſs to redeem them; he draws his own Image upon them; he loves and delights in them as the purchaſe of his Blood, and the little pictures of himſelf; he is indeed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully taken and raviſhed in them, as if they had unhearted him, or carried away his heart. In like manner Believers, though not in equal degrees, have a great Love to him; they put off corrupt ſelf for him; their old earthly members are crucified with him; their ſouls thirſt and faint in holy deſires after him; ſo high a rate and value is ſet upon him, that all other things are but as droſs and dung in compariſon; ſuch are the pleaſures and complacencies which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60571:72"/>they have in him, that they can joy in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and glory in reproaches for him, his Preſence and Love ſweetens every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: thus there is an union of Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers. But this is not all, ſome of the ancient Fathers ſeem to hint ſomewhat more.<note place="margin">De Trinit. lib. <hi>8.</hi> in Joh.</note> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> contend that our union with Chriſt is not meerly <hi>per concordiam voluntatis,</hi> by a Concord of will.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the thing it ſelf. To make it appear that our union with Chriſt is not meerly a moral one, I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>The conjugal union (which is the higheſt pattern of Love here below) is not meerly a Moral one. In the firſt Marriage there was ſomewhat antecedent to Love. <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of the ſide of ſleeping <hi>Adam.</hi> Hence he ſaid, That ſhe was <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> In the ſpiritual marriage there is ſomewhat antecedent to the Churches Love; ſhe was taken out of the ſide of Chriſt dying on the Croſs. Hence the Apoſtle (after he hath compared the Love of Husbands and Wives with that which is between Chriſt and the Church) doth in alluſion to the Primitive Marriage
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60571:73"/>tell us, <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Epheſ. 5.30. Fleſh may be conſidered either as to its ſubſtance, or as to its ſanctity; as to its ſubſtance, Chriſt is of our fleſh and bone; but as to its ſanctity, we are of his fleſh and bone; all the holy fleſh in the world is from Chriſt. Again, in common ordinary Marriages there is not meerly Love, but Man and Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one fleſh: In the ſpiritual Marriage there is not meerly Love, but Chriſt and Believers become one Spirit; the ſame holy Spirit which is upon Chriſt the Head, falls down on his Members; there are continual influences of Grace coming down from him unto them.</p>
               <p>Nothing in all the world is more apt or proper to ſhadow forth our union with Chriſt as Moral, than the conjugal Union is; though, as I ſaid but now, there is more in it than meer Love, yet is it the higheſt Samplar of Love on Earth; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count very apt to ſet forth our Moral Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; but though it be ſo, yet the Holy Ghoſt doth not, in ſhewing forth our union with Chriſt, reſt in that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; but goes on to ſhew it forth by others of a different tendency; as by a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, a Vine or Head, an Aliment, whoſe proper genuine import is not love, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60571:73"/>or vital influence, or intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: The Holy Ghoſt in theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances ſpeaks like it ſelf, aptly and truly; though there be no propriety in the words, yet there is an aptitude in the things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note Heavenly Myſteries; though the terms be metaphorical, yet the truths are real; there is a proportion and juſt Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the earthly ſhadow and heavenly myſtery; there is that in Chriſt which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all the reſemblances; he is to his Church a foundation for ſupport; a root or head for vital influence; an Aliment for nouriſhment and intimate conjunction. Hence it appears, that our union with Chriſt is not meerly a Moral one, but ſuch as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds to all the reſemblances; not only to the conjugal one in Love, but to all the other in their ſeveral imports.</p>
               <p>One Chriſtian is united to another in Affection. Love is the badg of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: The Primitive Chriſtians were of one heart, and one ſoul, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. They were as it were but one Man: the very <hi>Pagans</hi> pointed at this, ſaying,<note place="margin">Tert. Ap.</note> 
                  <hi>Vide ut ſe invicem diligant,</hi> ſee how they love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Love is the very bond of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. it couples all Virtues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as in a chain; it conjoins all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the myſtical body; where Love
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60571:74"/>is, there are all other Virtues; where one Chriſtian is, there are all the reſt in heart and affection. Love, which is a ſacred fire kindled upon the heart by the Holy Spirit, firſt aſcends up to God its primary object, who is to be loved for himſelf; and then it goes on to our neighbour, its ſecondary object, who is to be loved for Gods ſake: this is the way of Love; if it aſcend to God, it will go out to our Brother; if it go not out to our Brother, it never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to God. Hence St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſhutteth up his bowels from his brother, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17. The Love of God can no more be ſevered from the Love of our Brother, than the firſt Table of the Law can be rent off from the ſecond. All true Chriſtians are born of the ſame Father in Heaven; waſhed in the blood of the ſame Saviour; inſpired by the influences of the ſame Holy Spirit; intereſted in the ſame Charter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and inſtated in the ſame Inheritance above.<note place="margin">Sic muto, quod dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, amore diligimus, quoniam odiſſe non novimus, ſic nos, quod invidetis, fratres vocamus, ut unius Dei parentis homines, ut conſortes fidei, ut ſpei coharedes, <hi>Minuc. Fel.</hi> in Oct.</note> All of them therefore muſt needs be united together in Love; nothing is more evident, than that one Chriſtian is united to another in Love; but yet he is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60571:74"/>not ſo united to him, as he is unto Chriſt; Who? where is the Saint that will or dare ſay to his fellow Chriſtians, <hi>I am the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ye are the building, born up by me: I am the vine, ye the branches; without me ye can do nothing: I am the head, ye are the members; from me is all that effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is in you?</hi> Who can or may ſpeak after ſuch a rate? ſuch words are proper for Chriſt only; we are to fix our Faith upon him, not upon our fellow-Chriſtians: <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. Love is for our Brother, but Faith for Chriſt only; no meer creature is an object fit for it: <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man,</hi> Jer. 17.5. We are united to Chriſt as an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing Head, not ſo to our fellow-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The Wiſe Virgins had Oyl little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for themſelves; the moſt excellent Chriſtians have no Grace to ſpare; the great ſpring of all Grace is in Chriſt the Head; to go to another than him for it, is to fall off from him; and, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Worſhippers of Angels, <hi>Not to hold the head, from which all the body by joints and bands, having nouriſhment mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19. Might we have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60571:75"/>Grace from another, He, who is the Head and univerſal Principle of Grace, would become uſeleſs, and altogether ſuperfluous. The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who earneſtly contend that the Pope is Head of the Church, do yet qualifie their opinion,<note place="margin">Aqu. <hi>3.</hi> pars qu. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> and ſay, That the Pope is only Head <hi>ſecundum exteriorem gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernationem,</hi> according to external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but Chriſt alone is Head, <hi>ſecundum interiorem influxum,</hi> according to internal influx: Chriſtians are united one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Love; but unto Chriſt they are united, as unto an Head of influence. Hence the union is more than a Moral one.</p>
               <p>There is an union of Love between Chriſt and the Holy Angels; they are the top of the Creation, ſublime in Knowledg, unſpotted in Sanctity, excellent in Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ever a miniſtring to the Church, and doing one piece of the Divine Will or other; it cannot be otherwiſe, but that he muſt have a great Love for them; he is the brightneſs of the Fathers Glory; the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or expreſs Image of his Perſon; he made the Angelical World and all its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; he came down into the humane nature to repair us, and raiſe us up out of the ruins of the fall; the higheſt deſign of Gods Glory was carried on by him; the Divine Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice, Mercy,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60571:75"/>Truth, did ſhew forth themſelves upon the Theater of his humane Nature; the Holy Angels cannot but have a Love for him, and (becauſe he is an object of Excellency, and they creatures of perfection) their Love to him muſt be a very Eminent one: their Intellects have not, as ours, any blinds or dark ſhades in them, but are full of pure and coeleſtial light; they have not, as we, only ſome glimpſes, but a full view of the attractive Beauties and Excellencies in him; their Love is not as ours, ſubject to damps and clogs of corruption, but ever pure, and in holy Orders; they do not as we, dwell here below in houſes of Clay, but ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, attending upon his glorious Perſon: All which muſt needs promote their Love in a very high degree. Thus there is an union of Love between Chriſt and Angels. But if in the glaſs of Scripture we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the union between Chriſt and Believers, we ſhall find much more in it, than in that between him and Angels; there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation: Chriſt took on him, not the nature of Angels, but of men; he died on a Croſs, not for Angels, but for men; our union with him is founded on his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and atoning-Paſſion, but the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels is not ſo. There is alſo a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way; it is very proper for us fallen
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60571:76"/>creatures to be joined to a Mediator; not ſo for Angels, who ſtand in their integrity without need of a Mediator; in us there is an unitive Grace, Faith in a Mediator; not ſo in Angels, they have a Faith of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God; but, I ſuppoſe, they have not a Faith of recumbence in a Mediator; it is through the ſatisfactory and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sufferings of Chriſt that the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit which is upon him the head, comes down upon us his members, to repair the Divine Image in us; but it is not ſo with Angels; the Grace given unto them is not repairing, but confirming; neither doth it proceed through the blood of a Mediator, but immediately from God. Theſe things conſidered, our union with Chriſt muſt needs be more than a Moral one, as having that in it, which cannot be found in the union of Angels with him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> The union between Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is ſuch, that he doth ſupport them. The reſemblance of the foundation and building is a very lively and genuine proof of this; the building doth not bear up it ſelf, but is ſupported by the foundation; Believers do not bear up themſelves, but are ſupported by Chriſt: this is a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing to conſider. <hi>Adam</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency had not the leaſt ſeed of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60571:76"/>in him, yet he fell: Angels, much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than he, had no corruption or tempter, yet many of them fell, but Believers are ſupported; there are dregs and reliques of corruption in them; there are alluring and flattering objects round about them; there is a ſubtile Devil, uſing many arts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to draw out their corruption into act; yet in theſe dangerous circumſtances they are ſupported, becauſe they are united to Chriſt: there is a very remarkable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Angels and men. Angels ſtood or fell perſonally only, not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in an head of their own nature; but it is otherwiſe with men: All mankind fell in <hi>Adam</hi> their root or head, and all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtand in Chriſt the root and head of the Church: hence it is that they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: hence they are ſaid to be preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency was ſoon unframed, but they ſtand in Chriſt; in him one ſin drove out a ſtock of pure immaculate Grace in a moment; in them the many remnants of corruption cannot do ſo; the reaſon is, he with his perfect Graces ſtood alone, but they with their imperfect ones are in union with Chriſt: Hence it is, that their Graces live like a ſpark in water, and ſpring up even in the midſt of briars: Corruption is driven
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60571:77"/>out by little and little; and at laſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is attained in Heaven; if they ſtumble and fall in the way thither, yet they riſe again; the Holy Spirit viſits them again; freſh acts of Faith and Repentance are put forth;<note place="margin">Aug. de Cor. cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Humiliores redeunt &amp; doctiores;</hi> they become more humble and learned, eſpecially in that great point of dependance upon Chriſt; they ſee plainly, that they are weak in themſelves, and all their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is in him: One object, one forbidden tree drew away <hi>Adam</hi> from God, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objects cannot draw away Believers from Chriſt; though their corrupt fleſh (ſuch is its inordinate propenſity to outward and ſenſible things) would cloſe with every thing, and turn the whole world into Snares and Idols, yet are they not drawn away; their Faith is a victory over the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4; not meerly in it ſelf as it is a Divine Grace, but as it unites them to Chriſt, who overcame the world; not as a private perſon, but as a publick one on their behalf, that it might be but as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate pinioned enemy to them, that they through his Spirit communicated to them, might alſo overcome it; he did not gather them up out of the corrupt world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they might return thither again; their union with him is ſo near and ſtrong,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60571:77"/>that the world cannot take them back to it ſelf again; its flatteries cannot allure; its fears cannot fright them away from him; Satan overthrew <hi>Adam,</hi> but he cannot do ſo with Believers; in aſſaulting him, he had only to do with a man; but in aſſaulting them, he ſets upon thoſe who are myſtical parts and members of Chriſt; he hath to do with Chriſt himſelf, who is God as well as man; his hand is too ſtrong for Satan to pluck them away from him; his Love is too great to loſe his own members whom he hath purchaſed at no leſs price than his own blood. It's true, they do ſometimes fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptation, but then they do not fall as <hi>Adam</hi> did; they do not as he, loſe the very ſtate of Grace, or all the power of a recovery; no, the habits or vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Grace are not extinct; the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt will raiſe them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Satans conqueſt is not a total or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one; at laſt he ſhall be bruiſed under their feet. Chriſt, who in his own perſon conquered the Tempter, conquers him in his members alſo. Thus Believers are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, becauſe they are in union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> The union between Chriſt and Believers is ſuch, that he doth influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The reſemblances of the Vine and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60571:78"/>the Head do naturally teach this: A Vine communicates to the branches, an Head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences into the members; Chriſt could not be (what the Scripture calls him) a Vine or an Head, unleſs he did influence into his branches and members. There are two ſorts of influences; ſome are firſt and fundamental to our union with Chriſt, others do in order of nature follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The firſt fundamental influences are thoſe which work the unitive Grace of Faith. Men are not native branches or members of Chriſt, but inſititious ones. Faith, which implants and incorporates them into him, is not from Nature, but Grace. The ancient Council tells us,<note place="margin">Conc. Aranſ. Can. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> that it is <hi>per infuſionem &amp; inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Spiritûs Sancti,</hi> by the infuſion and inſpiration of the holy Spirit: Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſends out the Spirit with its inward teachings and tractions to work faith in men, to gather them into union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: thus the union begins from him. Faith, the firſt Grace that touches upon him, is wrought by his Spirit, and upon account of his Merits;<hi>To you it is given <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for Chriſts ſake to believe,</hi> Phil. 1.29. Were it not for this influence, there could be no union, no branches or members in him.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60571:78"/>
               <p>The after-influences are thoſe which ſerve to perfect the Believer; as in the Old Creation Light was the firſt-born, and then the other parts of the world were made; ſo in the New, the firſt thing is the Light of Faith; and then follow thoſe Graces which make up the new Creature: Love, Mercy, Meekneſs, Zeal, Obedience, Patience, are the fruits of the influencing Spirit, the Rivers of living water in the Believer: all of them are derived from Chriſt the Head through faith (which is called the Churches Neck, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.4.) into the myſtical body; after this manner are all Graces formed; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe influences there would be in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers no Graces or Conformity to Chriſt; no fit Temple for the Holy Spirit to dwell in. Again, there are influences not only to form theſe Graces, but to actuate them. As natural Agents live and move in the God of Nature; ſo Believers, who are ſpiritual Agents, live and move in Chriſt their Head: the gracious Principles in them do not go alone, but the Holy Spirit ſtirs them up, and then the ſpices flow out: Love and Joy, and all other Graces ſhew forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuitable Operations. St. <hi>Paul</hi> excellently deſcribes this, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Take a Believer burning in Zeal, or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60571:79"/>in Charity, or ſweating in Obedience, or doing ought in an holy manner; ſtill Chriſt lives in him; the effectual working is from the Head in Heaven; without theſe influences, Graces do but ſleep in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and not go forth into act.</p>
               <p>Further, There are not only influences to actuate Graces in Believers, but to make them grow up into Chriſt in all things; the Believer doth not ſtand at a ſtay; no, the firſt little dawn in his heart increaſes into a morning; the ſmall grain of muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed becomes a tree; the little Embrio or Babe in Chriſt grows to be a man of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtature; his humility is every day lower; his holy deſires riſe higher than before; the vitals of Faith and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come warmer than ever: and all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is from the effectual working; it is no other than the growing up of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into their influencing Head; the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and ſpreading of the new Creature under the dews of the Spirit. Without theſe influences Believers would be at a ſtand, and never arrive at any ſtatures in Grace. Thus it appears that theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are excellent and neceſſary. Were it not for the firſt influences, Chriſt would have no members, and ſo not be what he was ordained to be, an Head to the Church.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60571:79"/>Were it not for the after-influences, he would not carry himſelf as becomes an Head, neither would his members be ſuch as they ought to be in the point of holy graces.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> The union between Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is a very intimate one. The reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of food doth notably ſet forth this; food is very intimately united to the body, and ſo is Chriſt to believers. Our Saviour takes notice of this, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> Joh. 6.56. The words import a very near union. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaking of this,<note place="margin">De Caenâ Domini.</note> ſaith, <hi>Manſio noſira in ipſo eſt mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio, &amp; potus quaſi quaedam incorporatio:</hi> Our eating of him is manſion; our drinking a kind of incorporation; we are ſpiritually incorporated into him.<note place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr. <hi>Hom. 1.</hi>

                  </note> we do as it were paſs into his fleſh, who was made fleſh with us; we dwell in him, and he in us, and what can be nearer? though he be not, as ordinary food inferior to the body is, turned into our ſubſtance; yet as ſpiritual food more excellent than our ſouls, he turns us into his Divine image. We live by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57. He is our life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fountain and principle of it; therefore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60571:80"/>he muſt needs be nearly and intimately united to us,<note place="margin">Nemo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit vitâ extra ſe poſitâ, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis. <hi>Zanch. de tribus El. Li. 4. c. 3.</hi>
                  </note> eſpecially ſeeing he is ſo our life, that he communicates his own Spirit to us; the ſame holy Spirit which is upon him, falls down upon us as myſtical parts and members of him, to quicken and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate us in the holy ways of God. And what an union is this! actuation by one ſpirit is an union much more high and cloſe than that which is only by continuity, or a meer adheſion of parts; a branch, from which the juice retires, rather hangs on, than is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly united to the root; a member, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever adhering, if void and deſolate of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits, is as if it were not knit unto the Head; the moſt ſtrict and proper union is from one Spirit. Believers are ſo joined to Chriſt as to be one ſpirit; if they had not his ſpirit, they were none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>They are led by the ſpirit of God,</hi> v. 14. (which is the very ſame with the Spirit of Chriſt, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 9.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they are acted and moved by the Spirit of Chriſt. Thus there is the ſame Spirit in Chriſt and believers, and ſo the union between them muſt needs be very cloſe and intimate; in reſpect of this intimacy it is, that Chriſt compares this union with that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. And the Apoſtle calls Chriſt and the Church by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60571:80"/>one name: <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the member- of that one body being many, are one body; ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. in which place the Church is called Chriſt; the Scripture ſometimes ſpeaks of Chriſt and the Church, the head and the body, as if they were one perſon. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that believers are made <hi>cum homine Chriſto unus Chriſtus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De pecc. Mer. <hi>l. 1. c. 31.</hi>
                  </note> One Chriſt with the man Chriſt. Hence <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are <hi>una perſona myſtica,</hi> one myſtical perſon. Not that we are Chriſted with Chriſt, as ſome have ſaid; but that there is a very intimate union between Chriſt and believers.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> The union between Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is a myſtical one; there is a great myſtery in it: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 5.32. It is not meerly a myſtery, but a great one. In another place he ſaith, <hi>The riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. He ſpeaks of Chriſt, not meerly as offered in the Goſpel, but as dwelling in the heart; this he calls not barely a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the riches of the glory of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; it is ſuch a myſtery as hath riches
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60571:81"/>and glory in it. Now to make it appear, that this union is a myſtical one, I ſhall offer ſome things.</p>
               <p>There is that in this union which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all the reſemblances; the Holy Ghoſt in ſetting forth this union, did not ſtay in one or two earthly patterns, but uſeth many, going on from one thing to another, from Politicks to Oeconomicks, from Oeconomicks to Artificials, from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials to Naturals of divers kinds, that ſo from each, ſomewhat might be borrowed to illuſtrate it. In the Political union we have Law and Power; in the Conjugal one, love; in the Architectonical one, ſupport; in that of the Vine and Head, vital influence; in that of food, nouriſhment and intimate conjunction; but in the myſtical union we have all theſe. It is ſaid of Manna, that it ſuited to every palate; it is certain of Chriſt the true Manna, that he is All to the Church. That union therefore which fully anſwers to ſo many reſemblances of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent import, muſt needs be a very myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one.</p>
               <p>There is that in this union which high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeds all the reſemblances. In them there is but a ſhadow, but in that is the ſubſtance; in them one creature is united to another, but in that believers are united
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60571:81"/>to God-man. The Myſtical union is built upon the Hypoſtatical; in each of them there is ſome import, but none of them can reach the perfections of Chriſt. Never was there ſuch a King as he; he is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one; his ſubjects are all Saints, and of the ſeed Royal; his Throne and Laws are within; he inſpires, as well as commands his people. Never ſuch an Husband as he! he took an humane nature, that he might eſpouſe us; nay, he died on a Croſs, that his Spouſe might come forth out of his bleeding ſide. Thoſe who are joined in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual marriage, are made one ſpirit with him, and have admirable communications from him. No foundation is like him, who is laid not by humane art, but divine; and bears up the weight of the whole Church, not as dead matter doth, but by his Spirit of life. He is a Vine, whoſe juice is the holy Spirit, filling every branch; an Head, who makes thoſe who were no members, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come members; and afterwards actuates them by the influences of his Spirit. He is ſuch food as turns the eater into himſelf, and nouriſhes him unto life eternal. Every way he hath the preeminence over the earthly patterns. That union therefore which doth not only anſwer unto, but far exceed all the reſemblances of it, muſt needs be a myſterious one.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60571:82"/>
               <p>This union is ſuch, that no diſtance of place or time can break or diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>No diſtance of place can do it. In meerly Political or Moral unions, diſtance of place hinders not, but vital influence appertains not to them. In the natural Vine or Head there is a vital influence, but then there muſt be a local conjunction, the Vine doth not communicate juice to a diſtant branch, nor an Head to a diſtant member; but though Chriſt be in Heaven, and believers on earth, yet he influences life and ſtrength into them. The reaſon is, becauſe he doth it by a ſpirit which is infinite; a finite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot at once move and actuate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſubjects; yet an infinite one, which is every where, can do it. The ſame holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is in Chriſt above, is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us here below, to move and actuate us; the vital influence is not at all hindred by local diſtance. When our Lord diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. they murmured, and ſaid, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Our Saviour knowing this, returns them this anſwer, <hi>Doth this offend you? What if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up</hi> where he was before? <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, ver.</hi> 61, 62, 63. There was no reaſon to be offended at his Doctrine, <hi>He would aſcend
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60571:82"/>up to heaven;</hi> and then his fleſh would be as diſtant from men as heaven is from earth, yet this hinders not eating of, or union with him. The Spirit would be in and with the eater to quicken and ſtrengthen him. No local diſtance can interrupt this union or influence. I conclude this with the words of the Reverend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Serm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, 1620.</note> 
                  <hi>The union between Chriſt and believers is altogether ſpiritual and ſupernatural; no Phyſical or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical continuity or contiguity is any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite thereunto; it is ſufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this union, that Chriſt and we be knit together by thoſe ſpiritual ligatures, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit, and a lively faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, no diſtance of time can do it. In all the earthly patterns, the united are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in time; but the ancient Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, who were in time before the Incarnation of our Saviour, were yet united to him; ſaved they were, and by whom, but by him who is the only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world? Salvation is not in any other; his name is the only name under heaven for that end. A Mediator they had, and who could that be, but the one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus? no other but he could be really ſuch. A pardon they had, and not without ſhedding of blood; the blood of bulls and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60571:83"/>goats could not take away ſin, it was only the blood of Chriſt could do it. At the laſt day they ſhall be raiſed up to life, and that becauſe they are members of Chriſt: <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. In theſe words both the <hi>(Alls)</hi> reſpect members only, the laſt <hi>(All)</hi> refers only to Chriſts members; this is very evident, Chriſt is oppoſed to <hi>Adam;</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> members only die, in Chriſt members only are made alive. In the next verſe it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt roſe as the firſt fruits, and afterwards they that are Chriſts;</hi> that is, the members of Chriſt, who are the ſanctified lump. Wicked men riſe again by virtue of the threatning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death; but all the Saints ancient or lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, riſe as parts and members of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the Myſtical union, two things may be noted, the foundation of it, and the bonds. The foundation is the ſatisfactory and meritorious Paſſion of Chriſt; out of which ſprings the Church which is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the bonds are faith and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Faith aſcends up to him, the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes down upon believers. If we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe things to the ancient Saints, it will appear that they were united to Chriſt; his Death, which is the foundation, was for them. He died, as the Scripture tells us,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60571:83"/>for all, for every man: He gave himſelf for the world, the whole world. Which phraſes muſt needs take in thoſe under the Old Teſtament as well as thoſe under the New; and which is moſt expreſs, he is a Mediator for the redemption of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. The Ancients were not ſaved by types and ſhadows, but by Chriſt. Their Moral guilt was not done away by the blood of brutes, but by his only ſacrifice, which though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up but once in the end of the world, was in virtue all one as if he had been ſlain from the beginning of time. Thus the foundation did reach unto them. Neither were the bonds of union wanting; they had faith in Chriſt: the firſt promiſe of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. did point out his humane nature in the ſeed of the Woman, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings therein in the bruiſe of the heel; his victory over Satan in the breaking of the head; there was much of Chriſt in that firſt Goſpel: I doubt not but <hi>Adam</hi> had his eyes opened to ſee him there. <hi>Abel</hi> by faith offered up a Sacrifice to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. that is, by a faith proper to a ſacrifice, ſuch as did look through it to the great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Meſſiah. <hi>Abraham</hi> is a great pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of believing, even to us who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. His faith and ours have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60571:84"/>not variant objects or centers, but both are ſet upon one and the ſame Chriſt. He ſaw Chriſt a coming at a very great diſtance; we ſee him come in the fleſh: <hi>Venturus &amp; vexit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilit. Panit.</note> 
                  <hi>diverſa verba ſunt, ſed idem Chriſtus; to come, and come,</hi> are two different words, but it is the ſame Chriſt, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> It is the ſame faith for ſubſtance in both; the Fathers in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time <hi>did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that ſpiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.3, 4. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers did look only at the figure, the Manna and the Rock; but the believers did by faith feed upon Chriſt: <hi>Erant ibi</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>qui quod manducabant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilit. Panit.</note> 
                  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligebant; erant ibi, quibus plus Chriſtus in corde quàm Manna in ore ſapiebat;</hi> there were there thoſe who underſtood what they eat; there were thoſe who did more reliſh Chriſt in the heart, than Manna in the mouth. Thus the Ancients had faith in Chriſt; and, which ever accompanies it, they had the holy Spirit alſo. What were <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Meekneſs, <hi>David</hi>'s Zeal, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience, <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience, but the fruits of the holy Spirit communicated from Chriſt the head? He is void of the holy Spirit, who denies it to be there where ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60571:84"/>graces are; Gods ancient people had the good Spirit to inſtruct them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.20. <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51.11. The holy Spirit was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated under the Old Teſtament. Theſe things make it appear, that the Ancients were united unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But poſſibly it may be objected, The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union is to Chriſt, God-man; in the time of thoſe Ancients he was not man, they therefore were not united unto him; union cannot be to a <hi>non-entity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Ver, Relig. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> a thing that is not; <hi>quis non videt, in eum qui non eſt, credi minimè poſſe?</hi> who ſeeth not, that a man cannot believe in him who is not? So <hi>Volkelius.</hi> The like may be ſaid of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a man cannot be united to him who is not.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this objection, I ſhall offer two or three things.</p>
               <p>Were that of the <hi>Socinians</hi> true, That Chriſt was not in being till he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Virgin, this objection might be ſomething; but before the Incarnation he was a Divine perſon; after it, he was the very ſame perſon in our aſſumed fleſh; ſo the union of the Ancients was not to a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entity,</hi> or to one not in being.</p>
               <p>Chriſts humane nature, though not in actual being in thoſe times, was yet preſent
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60571:85"/>in ſuch ſort, that the Ancients were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being united to him; it was preſent with their Faith; though it had not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute exiſtence, as a thing put forth out of its cauſes; yet it had a relative exiſtence in the promiſe, ſo as to be an object of their Faith; which, being the hypoſtaſis or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of things hoped for, could not but preſentiate the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to them, he being one of the prime things they looked for, and upon that account called the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Acts 28.20. It was alſo preſent with God in his Decree, as ſure to be as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rolls could make it. Its ſatisfactory and meritorious blood did operate before it was ſhed; upon the account of it, Pardons and the Holy Spirit were communicated unto the ancient believers. That preſence, which made them capable of the bonds of union, made them capable of the union it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There is a difference between the natural body and the myſtical; in the natural body the members are ſimultaneous; but in the myſtical one they are ſucceſſive. Some members are before others, yet they are all but one body; ſome were before Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, yet were they united unto him as their Head. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> elegantly ſets forth this from <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe hand came out firſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60571:85"/>and then his head;<note place="margin">De Catech. rud. cap. <hi>3.</hi> and <hi>19.</hi> in Pſal. <hi>61.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Manus a capite praemitti poteſt, connexio tamen ejus ſub capite eſt,</hi> the hand may be firſt ſent forth by the head, yet is it united to the head; all the ancient Saints were but, as it were, <hi>manus Chriſti,</hi> the hand of Chriſt; though they came forth before he the Head came in the fleſh, yet they were united to him, and had a virtue and Divine Spirit from him; though they were firſt in time, yet he was firſt in dignity and power: Had theſe not been members of him, there would have been after the fall ſome holy fleſh not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him; which to imagine, is to render him uſeleſs, as if the forfeited ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in man might have been recovered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all is this, That Union, which no diſtance of place or time can break or diſſolve, muſt needs have a great deal of myſtery in it.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7thly.</hi> The Union between Chriſt and Believers is laſting and durable; were it not ſo, very black conſequences muſt needs enſue. There might poſſibly be no Church at all; that Article of our Creed, which concerns the Holy Catholick Church and the Communion of Saints, might ceaſe and become no object of Faith; the death of Chriſt might be in vain; his precious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60571:86"/>might be without fruit; the great Promiſes, as well thoſe which are made to Chriſt touching a ſeed, as thoſe which are made to Chriſtians touching perſeverance, might utterly fail and come to nothing. Theſe are very momentous things; yet paſſing them over, it will ſuffice to conſider what a King, Husband, Foundation, Vine, Head, Food, Chriſt is; the excellency of him above all the earthly patterns, will evidently prove the perpetuity of this Union.</p>
               <p>He is ſuch a King as never was; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtands upon foundations that cannot be ſhaken. Earthly kingdoms may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a defection of Subjects, the Prince cannot command their minds and wills; the outward Thrones and Laws may be too weak to keep them in due order; a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of yokes and burdens may blow the coal; a fancy of being better under a change may kindle a fatal Rebellion; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the preſent Government is ever grievous. But it is not thus in Chriſts Kingdom; his Subjects never fall off; he inſpires obedience into their wills and hearts; his Throne and Law are within; there are no blots or errata's in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all is meer rectitude and Grace, they cannot be better than under him; in ſuch
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60571:86"/>circumſtances no room is left for a revolt. The kingdoms of this world may be broken by a foreign invaſion; one earthly power may eat up another; the great Empire rowl'd about from the <hi>Chaldean</hi> to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Grecian,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Roman;</hi> but in the Kingdom of Chriſt it is not ſo; his Kingdom ſhall not be left to other people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. No invaſion can be upon him who hath all the power in Heaven and Earth; he ſits at Gods right hand till his enemies be made his footſtool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. till Sin, Satan, the World, Death, Hell be ſubdued under him; no foreign power therefore can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his Kingdom, who is univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. Earthly kingdoms have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, there is a <hi>mene</hi> wrote upon each of them; the Gold, Silver, Braſs, Iron, Clay, in the great Image, muſt at laſt be all broken to pieces, and become like the chaff of the Summer threſhing-floor, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35. But it is not ſo with Chriſt; his Throne is as the Sun, and as the faithful witneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.36, 37. Of his Kingdom there is no end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. It is a thing of perpetuity. But if his Subjects might fall off, where, what would his Kingdom be? A Kingdom without Subjects, is but an <hi>umbra,</hi> a meer ſhadow. It may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60571:87"/>noted, that in that 89th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> there is not only a Throne continuing, but a ſeed enduring for ever. And in that firſt of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> there is not only an endleſs Kingdom, but an Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Church for him to regin over for ever; without this, his Kingdom would ſoon be at an end for want of Subjects. If then his Kingdom be, as it is, perpetual, then there muſt needs be a continuance of Subjects under him.</p>
               <p>He is ſuch an Husband as never was, his conjunction with his Spouſe is never diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the earthly marriage may be diſſolved by Adultery, but in the ſpiritual Marriage between Chriſt and Believers no ſuch thing falls out; truth and faithfulneſs are found on all hands; he will never forſake them; they will not forſake him; his fear in their heart keeps them from a departure; his love is towards them; their love is towards him; if it cool or ſlack, his love (which is the fountain and firſt mover) will come and inflame theirs afreſh; nay, there is not only love, or a likeneſs of temper between them, but they are ſo joined to him as to be one ſpirit; two ſpirits may vary and go different ways, but one ſpirit muſt needs keep them together; here is no room for ſpiritual fornication or departure from Chriſt. Further, Death parts man and wife,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60571:87"/>but not Chriſt and Believers; he died, but it was that he might purchaſe a Church, that a Spouſe might come out of his bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide; they dye, but their death is a ſleep in Jeſus, their union to him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; in Death there is a ſeparation of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul; but as in Chriſt it did not break the hypoſtatical union, ſo in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans it doth not break the myſtical one; his body in the grave was not ſeparate from his Divine perſon; their bodies there are not ſeparate from Chriſt the Head; his Spirit will not leave them in the duſt, but raiſe them up to a glorious life, as a ſure token, that they are in conjunction with him. The perpetuity of this conjunction is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth by the Prophet; <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in loving-kindneſs, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 2.19, 20. In this famous Text (which, as I take it, reſpects the ſpiritual Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Church) two or three things may be noted: Here we have <hi>(I will betroth, I will betroth, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth)</hi> thrice repeated, to note out the fureneſs of the Promiſe; here it is ſaid in expreſs terms, That the eſpouſal is not for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60571:88"/>a time, but for ever; here Chriſt engages his Righteouſneſs, Truth, Love, Mercy, Faithfulneſs, to make good the perpetual eſpouſal. In the cloſe it is added, <hi>Thou ſhalt know the Lord;</hi> the eſpouſed ſhall know, that their Lord Chriſt hath effected this great work.</p>
               <p>He is ſuch a Foundation as never was; all thoſe who are builded upon him ſhall ſtand; he is that Rock upon which the Church is built; <hi>The gates of hell,</hi> that is, the powers of darkneſs, <hi>ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matt. 16.18. This excellent Promiſe doth ſignifie the perpetuity of the union between Chriſt and Believers; if they were ſevered from him, then the Gates of Hell would prevail; but if (as the Promiſe is) the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail, then the union ſhall be perpetual. It may poſſibly be here objected, That this Promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not particular Believers, but the Church in general. I anſwer, This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe reaches to all that are built on the Rock by Faith, and ſo are particular Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; if ſome particular Believers may fall off from the Rock, ſo may all; and then where is the Church? what is that but a body made up of particular Believers? All Believers failing, the Church muſt needs do ſo. It may yet be objected, That the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60571:88"/>of that Promiſe is, That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt Believers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent. But I anſwer, It is not poſſible they ſhould prevail in any other way than that of conſent; a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may come, but without a conſent it prevails not: to ſay, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail without a conſent, is to ſay, That the Gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in any other way than that which is poſſible; and, this being true, without any Promiſe at all, the Promiſe thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſignifies juſt nothing, as being only of that which was ſo before. We are not then to take it ſo, but in the plain ſenſe; which gives us an high aſſurance, that thoſe who are built upon the Rock, ſhall never be removed from thence; no, not by all the powers of darkneſs. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt the Corner-ſtone, ſaith, <hi>In him all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the-Lord.</hi> The apt and harmonious framing of the building, ſhews the firmneſs of it; the growing of it tells us, That it is not as corruptible buildings, bore up by dead matter, but by that which is much more durable, the everliving Spirit of Chriſt. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame Corner-ſtone, ſaith, <hi>He that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. If
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60571:89"/>Believers, who are built upon him, might be ſevered from him, they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; but if they ſhall not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhall not be ſevered; in union with him is ſalvation, but in ſeparation from him is nothing but confuſion: ſuch a Foundation is he, that he bears up all that are built upon him; and prevents their confuſion by maintaining their union with him: None of the lively Stones ſhall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, finally, fall off from him.</p>
               <p>He is ſuch a Vine and Head as never was; his juice never ceaſes; his vital influences never fail: Hence the Branches and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ever remain in union with him. To make this appear, I ſhall offer two or three things:</p>
               <p>There is a ſupply of the Holy Spirit from Chriſt unto Believers; he is made ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to them; he lives in them; there is an effectual working in every one of them; and all this is by the Spirit communicated from him the Root and Head of all Grace. Hence he tells us, that the rivers of living water flow in the Believer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38.</p>
               <p>The ſupply of the Spirit from Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Believers,<note place="margin">In Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam virtutes ſemper manet ſpiritus, ſecundum quaſdam receſſurus venit, &amp; venturus recedit; in his virtutibus, ſine quibus ad vitam non pervenitur, in electorum ſuorum cordibus permanct. <hi>Greg.

                  </note> doth ever continue in ſome
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60571:89"/>meaſure; it's true, it doth not ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as to the acceſſaries of Grace; but it ever continues as to the vitals and eſſentials of it; it doth not keep them from all acts of ſin, but under their greateſt falls it ever upholds a ſtate of grace and ſpiritual life in them: They may fall, and that grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet ſtill there is a lamp, the habits and principles of Grace are not extinct in them; <hi>He that is born of God cannot ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. That is, he cannot ſin ſo as to unframe the new creature; he cannot ſin ſo, as to loſe the remaining ſeed in him; the Reaſon is, becauſe the Spirit continues to bear him up in a ſtate of Grace. This continuance of the Spirit is upon a double account, the one is the durable foundation of it; the communication of the Spirit is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſatisfactory and meritorious ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt; there is an endleſs life of merit in him; his blood is of an eternal efficacy: Hence the ſupplies of the Spirit procured thereby, never fail. Very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is the difference between the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and the caſe of Believers; in him one act of ſin drove out a ſtock of pure holineſs; in them many ſins do not drive out their imperfect graces; the Reaſon is, their graces reſpect a great foundation, an infinite treaſure of merit, which moves the

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60571:91"/>Spirit to bear them up in being; but his holineſs doth not do ſo. For them, as under the ſecond Covenant there is a ranſom, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of immenſe value to interpoſe, that the forfeiture of their habitual graces made by ſin may not be taken; but for, him as under the firſt Covenant there was nothing to interpoſe, nothing to bear off juſtice from taking the forfeiture. The other thing is the office of Chriſt; a Vine is to communicate juice to the Branches; an Head is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vital influences to the Members; the rich anointing of the Spirit was upon Chriſt not as a meer private perſon, but as a Truſtee and a Treaſurer for Believers, that out of his fulneſs they might have grace for grace. It lies upon his truth and faithfulneſs to perform his truſt and office; if he did not communicate the Spirit to his Branches and Members, he ſhould ceaſe to act like a Root and Head; but, becauſe he never does what unbecomes him, the communication muſt continue as long as he is a Root or Head. Upon theſe ſure grounds doth ſtand the continuance of the Spirit in its ſupplies; it may be ſometimes grieved by the ſins of Believers, yet it doth not depart from them, becauſe Chriſt is a Prieſt after the power of an endleſs life; and it is his truſt and office to communicate the Spirit to them.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60571:91"/>
               <p>The ſupply of the Spirit unto Believers ever continuing, their union with Chriſt muſt needs continue alſo. The Spirit is the primary bond of the Union; where the Spirit is, there is the Union; where the Spirit is continued, there is the Union con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Our Saviour ſpeaking of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to Believers, ſaith, that it is in them a Well of water ſpringing up to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. The Spirit is a Well that is never dried up; it is a Spring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe waters fail not; it ſprings and never leaves ſpringing till the Believer be in Heaven; the union therefore, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon ſuch an excellent communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, muſt needs be perpetual. I conclude with the judgment of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt and Believers, he ſaith, <hi>Illius capitis membra ſumus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Pſal. <hi>88.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>non poteſt hoc corpus decollari, ſi in aeternum caput, in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num gloriantur &amp; membra, ut ſit ille Chriſtus integer in aeternum.</hi> We are members of him the Head; this body cannot be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if the head be for ever, the members alſo glory for ever, that Chriſt may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire for ever. In another place, reproving the rule of <hi>Ticonius</hi> touching the bipartite body of Chriſt, he ſaith,<note place="margin">De Doct. Chriſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Non reverâ Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini corpus eſt, quod cum illo non erit in aeternum:</hi> It is not truly the body of Chriſt,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60571:92"/>which ſhall not be with him for ever.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, Chriſt is moſt excellent food; he is ſo in union with believers, that he nouriſhes them in their very ſouls: This union is ſo ſet forth in the 6th <hi>chapter</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> that it appears to be perpetual. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, and I in him,</hi> verſ. 56. Theſe words point out, not only the intimacy of the union, but the perpetuity of it: Here is not meerly an inbeing, but an indwelling, which imports duration. In a former <hi>verſe</hi> the perpetuity is more plainly ſet down; <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life,</hi> verſe 54. Chriſt nouriſheth him not to a temporal life, but to an eternal one; and how is this done but by an union with him? All food nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes by union; earthly food by union with the body; Chriſt the ſpiritual food by union with the ſoul: without union can be no nutrition; he therefore, who nouriſhes Believers, not to a temporal, but to an eternal life, muſt needs be united to them, not for a time, but perpetually. There is in that Chapter one thing more to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; we have in it both the bonds of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Faith is included in the eating and drinking there often repeated; the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit is mentioned, <hi>verſe</hi> 63. Faith
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60571:92"/>cannot fail, becauſe the Spirit continues to uphold it; the ſupplies of the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, becauſe the fleſh and blood of Chriſt hath in it an endleſs life of merit to procure the ſame: It remains therefore, that the union is perpetual, becauſe the bonds of it are ſo.</p>

The Spirit it ſelf is in ſome ſort communicated to Believers; he is ſent to them; he is given to them; he dwells in them; his ſpecial, operative, immediate preſence is with them; he forms Holy Graces in them; he actuates and preſerves thoſe Graces; he ſheds abroad Gods Love in their heart.

               <p>Faith doth in an admirable manner unite unto Chriſt; the Scripture ſets it forth, as if it had all motions, poſtures, and ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpiritually in it ſelf, to take in Chriſt with his incomparable benefits into the ſoul; it is there called, a ſeeing, a coming to, a receiving of, a leaning on, a putting on, a feeding upon Chriſt; it ſees and looks to him as a Saviour; it comes to him as a center of reſt; it receives him as a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift; it leans on him as a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it puts him on as an heavenly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it feeds on him as the very food and life of the ſoul. In St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (ſpeaking of the Woman who had an Iſſue of blood) Faith is called a touching of Chriſt:<note place="margin">In Luc. lib. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Non credunt qui comprimunt, credunt qui tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, fide tangitur Chriſtus;</hi> Many preſs upon Chriſt in outward Ordinances, but Believers touch him; it is by Faith that he is touched, ſo as to have virtue from him. In St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> it is not meerly a touching, but a taking hold of Chriſt:<note place="margin">In Joh. Tract. <hi>50.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an intellectual mouth in the inner man, whereby we feed upon Chriſt the bread of life. In St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> Faith is that by which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we are begotten and conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with Chriſt.<note place="margin">In Hebr. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> In <hi>Theophylact</hi> it is that by which a man is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a part of Chriſt the root, united to, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in him. The import of all theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expreſſions in Scriptures and Fathers, is this: That Faith is the great capacity which takes in Chriſt into the Soul.</p>
               <p>Touching this Bond of Faith, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer three or four things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> Faith doth ſee Chriſt in a ſpiritual manner. Humane reaſon, with the Goſpel before it, may gather up a notion of Chriſt, but it doth not of it ſelf ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him. A notion may be gathered up out of the words and ſentences in Scripture, but a ſpiritual diſcerning there is not. This is clear upon a double account. The one is this: In fallen man, no natural faculty (unleſs elevated by a grace proper to it) doth act ſpiritually; the Underſtanding,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60571:94"/>the ſupreme faculty in man (unleſs inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit) doth not do ſo; it acts upon Chriſt, as upon other objects in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way only. The other is this: To a ſpiritual diſcerning there is requiſite a due proportion between the object and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: ſuch a proportion there is between Chriſt, an object ſupernaturally revealed, and a mind ſupernaturally inlightned; there the Holy Spirit is on both hands; I mean, outwardly revealing the object in Scripture, and inwardly inlightning the mind to make it fit for the object; but between Chriſt a ſupernatural object, and a natural mind, there is not ſuch a proportion; the Holy Spirit is but on one hand, revealing the object; but on the other, there is only the humane Spirit; which without inward il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, doth not ſpiritually diſcern the things of God. If a meer natural mind might ſpiritually diſcern them, there would need no opening of eyes, no renewing in the ſpirit of the mind: the new Creature would be new but in part; the old under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (though that faculty firſt erred in the fall) might ſerve the turn. Faith, as far as it is in the Intellect, would not be the Gift of God, but of our ſelves; the external propoſal of the object (which is what grace <hi>Pelagius</hi> allowed) would be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60571:95"/>enough. But ſuch things as theſe being never to be admitted, it is evident, that ſpiritual diſcerning is not a thing common to Reaſon, but proper to Faith; which, having a divine Light in it, doth elevate the mind above it ſelf, and make it apt to diſcern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>There being in Faith a ſpiritual diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt is intellectually preſent with the Believer in an excellent manner; he is in ſome ſort intellectually preſent with a man of notion; but with the Believer, he is preſent in a more divine manner; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſpiritual beauty; the Spirit glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him in the heart. Oh! what an one is our <hi>Immanuel?</hi> how ſweet is his Name? how rich his Merits? how full his treaſures of Grace? Every thing in him appears in a kind of raviſhing glory; he is no longer looked on as a meer matter of ſpeculation, but as an object to be for ever loved, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, embraced, adored by us; the notion of him doth not lie dead upon the heart, but lives and warms the inner man into holy admirations and affections towards him; we have not a light opinion, but a firm perſwaſion touching him and his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, we can certainly pronounce, This is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60571:95"/>World. This is the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which made an atonement for us; we are as ſure of it, as if theſe things were before our corporeal eyes and ſenſes: nay, we are more ſure than ſo; we ſee them <hi>in lumine veritatis primae,</hi> in the light of the firſt Truth revealing himſelf in the Goſpel. This is the firſt ſtep of Union. Chriſt is ſpiritually diſcerned; he is intellectually preſent with our minds in a very excellent manner.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Faith doth put the ſoul into an apt and fit poſture for Chriſt; it ſets all ready and in order for him.</p>
               <p>In general, it doth this by making us poor in ſpirit: A natural man, though a fallen creature, is very high; in his own eyes he is as well as if he had had no bruiſe at all in the fall; as rich, as if nothing of mans Primitive excellency were loſt; he dreams and flatters himſelf, as if his reaſon could ſpan all Myſteries, and his will teem out all Virtues; he ſtands upon his own bottom, and wraps up himſelf in his own falſe Righteouſneſs; he is every way full, and wants nothing; compleat in himſelf, and knows no dependance. And why ſhould ſuch an one go to Chriſt, or ſeek Union with him? or what may be done for ſuch an one, who hath all in himſelf? This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60571:96"/>is not only at a vaſt diſtance from Chriſt, but it carries in it an utter enmity to him; when it ſpeaks out, it blaſphemes in ſome ſuch language, as that <hi>Pagan</hi> did, who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> in Pſal. 31. Praef.</note> 
                  <hi>Jam benè vivo, quid mihi neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius eſt Chriſtus?</hi> I live well of my ſelf; how is Chriſt neceſſary to me? But as ſoon as Faith comes, a man reflects and ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in natural ſelf, but poverty, emptineſs, impotency, uncleanneſs, perdition; he looks up to Chriſt, and ſees all riches, fulneſs, power, ſanctity, ſalvation to be in him; he humbles himſelf as knowing his dependance; he puts off his Ornaments, that Chriſt may do ſomewhat for him; he goes down into his own nothingneſs and deſolate ſelf-wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to have ſome Communications of Grace from Chriſt: this is the right poſture of the ſoul. Poverty here looks up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches. Emptineſs opens the heart for the effuſions of grace. Conſcience cries out to be cooled with the blood of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Impotence waits for the arm of a Saviour to be revealed. Nothingneſs calls for a new Creation to be erected upon the ruines of a lapſed nature. All things are ready for Chriſt to ſhew forth his Glory in the Believer.</p>
               <p>More particularly, Faith puts the ſoul into an apt poſture for Chriſt; in that it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60571:96"/>hath that in it which anſwers to all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; he is an excellent Prieſt; he offered up himſelf as a propitiating ſacrifice for us; he ſatisfied the Law and Juſtice of God; he made a full and perfect compenſation for the ſin of the world. Unto this, Faith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers by its recumbency; it ventures all upon Chriſt; it runs under the wings of its Saviour; it hides it ſelf in his precious wounds; it caſts the Believer on him who bore the ſin of a World; it rolls the ſoul on his atoning blood, and leaves it there for acceptance with God; it commits the whole concern of Juſtification as to the Law, to his Plenary ſatisfaction; it hath no other bottom to ſtand upon but this; no other anſwer to the Law; no other plea to divine Juſtice; no other refuge or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-place for the ſoul to repoſe it ſelf in: This is the right poſture; it is called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5.11. becauſe the Believer is in the very inſtant made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Chriſts ſacrifice; His atoning blood is ſprinkled on him; the great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction covers him as a myſtical part of Chriſt, that the Curſe of the Law may not ſeize him, or the wrath of God burn him up. Again, Chriſt is a great Prophet, he brought the holy Myſteries out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſom; he ſpeaks outwardly by his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60571:97"/>Word; and by his Spirit he is an inward <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> who can enter into the heart, and there expreſs himſelf in words of Life and Power. Unto this, Faith anſwers by an humble docibleneſs; it ſoftens and meekens the heart; it makes the Believer ſit down at Chriſts feet, and hear him in the hardeſt Lectures; if Chriſt talk of a Croſs, the Believer is ready to take it up upon his back; if of ſuper-rational Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he is ready to ſubſcribe to them; he becomes as a little child, ruleable by every holy beam or motion; he yeilds up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Spirit and Word to be inſtructed by them: this is the apt poſture; it is called an <hi>hearing of the Prophet,</hi> Acts 3.22. The Believer in this poſture is ſure to hear of him; he ſhall be more and more led into holy Truths; his ear is opened, and his mind in a readineſs for further inſtruction. The Spirit will make deeper impreſſions, and ſeal divine Truths upon his heart. The rich Mines of Precepts and Promiſes ſhall lye more open before his eyes. Again, Chriſt is a great King, higher than the Kings of the Earth; he was anointed with the Holy Ghoſt; he hath all the power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; his Laws are all rectitude and grace; his Throne muſt be ſet up in the hearts and ſpirits of men. Unto this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60571:97"/>Faith anſwers by that obediential temper which is in it; It owns his Soveraignty; it kiſſes his Scepter; it chuſes him as a Lord; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t loves to live in his Dominions; if he come forth in his Royal Command, it opens the everlaſting doors, that he may reign within: This is a fit poſture; it is called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,</hi> Col. 2.6. Chriſt will own ſuch as his Subjects; he will more and more lift up his Throne in their hearts; he will let them ſee more of his power and glory; he will make them taſte the fruits of his Government in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and excellent rewards: This is the ſecond ſtep of union between Chriſt and Believers. There is that in Faith which anſwers to all his Offices; there is ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in him, and recumbency in them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in him, and docibleneſs in them; Royalty in him, and obedientialneſs in them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> There is by faith a right unto Chriſt: God did not only ſend his Son in the fleſh to ſatisfie and merit for us, but he hath let down from Heaven a Charter of Promiſes, that we might ſee upon what terms we may have a title to Chriſt. By that Charter ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his blood, the believer (who alſo ſeals to it by faith) hath a clear right unto
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60571:98"/>him: <hi>My beloved is mine,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. Believers have a right to claim him as their own, though he be an infinite perſon, one who is a center of Perfections, a treaſury of merits; having in himſelf enough to ſatisfie the heart of God, and ſupply the wants of men, yet may they claim him as their own. His blood is theirs; it is the blood of their Sponſor and Head; it was ſhed on purpoſe to juſtifie them as to the Law, to cleanſe away their ſins. His Spirit is theirs, it is upon him as an Head and Truſtee, accordingly it is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them; it is to flow in their hearts in rivers of living graces. They have alſo a right to become the ſons of God. It's true, they are not as he is, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sons, but they are adopted ones. In their adoptive Sonſhip there is, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerves, a ſhadow of the Eternal One. He is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> or <hi>brightneſs of his Father,</hi> and in them there is a ſplendor of grace reſembling God in a meaſure; at laſt they ſhall as ſons enter into his joy, and ſit down with him in his Throne; and there not only behold his glory, but have a ſhare in the bleſſed region; and all this is made good by the Goſpel; one jot or tittle of which can no more fail, than God can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60571:98"/>his truth and faithfulneſs. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtep, there is by faith a true right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> There is by faith more than a meer right to Chriſt; there is an intimate union with him; believers are built upon him as a foundation, inſerted into him as a Vine, incorporated with him as an Head. To underſtand which of a meer right, is utterly to evacuate theſe Metaphors, which were planted in Scripture on purpoſe to ſignifie a very near union with him. It is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>That we are in him, and he is in us. We dwell in him, and he dwells in us. We abide in him, and he abides in us.</hi> To interpret theſe phraſes of a meer right, as if all the meaning were but this: We have a right to him, and he hath a right to us; is to diſpirit thoſe expreſſions, which do as Emphatically ſpeak a very near uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any words can poſſibly do. No man ever uſed ſuch words to expreſs a right; no man can uſe higher to expreſs an union. In thoſe phraſes therefore we have an intimate union ſet forth unto us; ſo alſo we have in that of the Apoſtle, <hi>We are made partakers of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 3.14. Not meerly of his benefits, but of himſelf. When the ſame Apoſtle would ſet forth the Hypoſtatical
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60571:99"/>union of our nature to Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he did partake of our fleſh and blood,</hi> Heb. 2.14. When in this place he would ſet forth the Myſtical union of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to him, he ſaith, <hi>That we are</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>partakers of him;</hi> we do in a ſort poſſeſs him, we partake of him as members do of their head. His ſatisfaction reaches down to us, to make us ſtand before God; his Spirit is communicated to us, to make us a fit Temple for himſelf. By faith we come to be in intimate union with him, and in a ſpiritual manner poſſeſſed of him.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching Faith as a bond of union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The other bond is the holy Spirit: The Scripture ſpeaks of it negatively and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: Negatively, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. The Spirit of Chriſt is that which juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called the Spirit of God, which quickens our mortal bodies, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. which leads the ſons of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. which makes them cry, <hi>Abba Father, ver.</hi> 15. which bears witneſs with their ſpirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He that hath not this Spirit in ſuch meaſure as is neceſſary to Salvation, he is none of Chriſts; he is not united to him as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, none of his members are void of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60571:99"/>Spirit. Poſitively, <hi>He that is joined unto the Lord, is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he is in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. The ſame holy Spirit which is upon Chriſt the Head, falls down upon believers as members of him; though Chriſt an infinite perſon aſſumed an humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though his humane nature was in the ſame perſon with his Divine; yet, (which is admirable to conſider) the holy Spirit had a ſpecial hand in uniting the humane nature to his perſon, and in ſanctifying it; the holy Spirit came upon the Virgin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. The holy Spirit deſcended like a Dove and lighted upon him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. His Divine Nature was alſufficient and near enough to the humane, yet <hi>was he anointed with the Holy Ghoſt and with power,</hi> Act. 10.38. The ſanctifying of his humane nature is in a peculiar manner attributed to the holy Spirit: The reaſon (I take it) is this, God in his wiſe counſel would have it to be ſo, that the ſame Spirit which united the two Natures in the Perſon of Chriſt, might unite us to him, being God-man in one Perſon, that the ſame Spirit which ſanctified his humane nature, might ſanctifie us members of him. It may yet further be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60571:100"/>obſerved, that that very Spirit, which, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Spiritus Sanctus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effabilis eſt quaedam Patris Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liique com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio. <hi>Auſt. de Trin. lib. 5. cap. 11.</hi> Inſinuatur nobis in Patre au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas, in Filio nativitas, in Spiritu Sancto Patris Filiique communitas, in tribus aequalitas; quod ergò commune eſt Patri &amp; Filio, per hoc nos voluerunt babere communionem &amp; inter nos &amp; ſecum; &amp; per illud donum nos colligere in unun, quod ambo habent unum, hoc eſt, per Spiritum Sanctum, Deum &amp; Dei donum. <hi>Auſt. de Verb.

                  </note> is the communion of the Father and the Son, doth unite us to Chriſt. If we put all together, we ſhall ſee the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be a moſt excellent bond: In the Trinity it is the communion of the Father and the Son; in Chriſt it is that which united the two natures, and ſanctified the humane; in us it is that which unites us to Chriſt. This is the primary Bond between Chriſt and Believers.</p>
               <p>Touching this bond, it is firſt to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in Scripture, not only the graces of the Spirit, but the Spirit it ſelf is ſaid to be communicated to Believers. To quote ſome places for this, <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5.5. <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you,</hi> Rom. 8.11. <hi>As many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſons of God,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60571:100"/>with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God,</hi> verſe. 16. <hi>Know ye not, that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. <hi>God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father,</hi> Gal. 4.6. In theſe Texts two things may be obſerved: The one is this, the Spirit it ſelf is meant; it is the Spirit it ſelf, which ſheds abroad the love of God in the heart, which quickens the mortal body, which leads the ſons of God, which beareth witneſs with our ſpirit; the Text is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Spirit it ſelf in expreſs terms: it is alſo the Spirit it ſelf, which hath a Temple in us, which makes us cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. The other is this, The Spirit it ſelf is communicated; it is given to us, it dwelleth in us, it leads and acts us, it bears witneſs with our ſpirit, it is in us as in its Temple, it is ſent forth into our hearts; all which do import communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Alſo, we may note as much in that Apoſtolical Prayer, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. Here are all the perſons in the Sacred Trinity named; here the Holy Ghoſt muſt needs be the Spirit it ſelf; none other but he is capable of being ranked with the Father and the Son: yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60571:101"/>there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a communication of him. Alſo we may gather the ſame thing from the Promiſes of the Spirit made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the 14, 15, 16 <hi>Chapters</hi> of St. <hi>John;</hi> there it is the Spirit it ſelf which is promiſed; it is the comforter, the ſpirit of truth; it is that ſpirit, which proceedeth from the Father, which teacheth all things, and bringeth all things to remembrance; which convinceth of ſin, and glorifies Chriſt; which takes the things of Chriſt, and ſhews them unto men; all which ſhew that it is the Spirit it ſelf. Alſo there it is promiſed to be communicated; it was to be ſent to them, to guide them into all truth, to dwell in them, to be in them, to abide with them for ever; all which do ſhew a communication of it. When the <hi>Greeks</hi> erroneouſly held, That the Spirit did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, not from the Father and the Son, but from the Father only; one argument uſed againſt them was this, If the Spirit was ſent from the Father and the Son, then it did proceed from both. To this the <hi>Greeks</hi> replied, That this ſending, meerly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gifts of the Spirit, not himſelf: but this is directly contrary to the ſcope of thoſe chapters in St. <hi>John;</hi> if the Spirit be ſent meerly becauſe we have his gifts, then the Father (which we no where read) may be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60571:101"/>ſaid to be ſent, becauſe we have his gifts; when the Scripture ſaith, that the Son was ſent, it was himſelf, not meerly his benefits; in like manner, when it ſaith, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſent, it is himſelf, not meerly his gifts.</p>
               <p>I may here add ſomewhat out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>Ignatius</hi> tells them, that they were bleſſed, being <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60571:102"/>
               <p>It ſeems by theſe things to be clear, that the Spirit it ſelf is communicated to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; neverthelſs it is a <hi>Quaere,</hi> how, or in what ſenſe the Spirit it ſelf is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I ſhall firſt take notice of three memorable expreſſions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; That is, the <hi>ſending of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>giving of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>dwelling</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting of the Spirit in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt expreſſion is the <hi>ſending of the Spirit;</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange, that an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, Alwiſe, Alpreſent Spirit ſhould be ſent; but this miſſion is not <hi>per imperium,</hi> as from one more potent than himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him; he is as high in power and majeſty as the other two perſons are; it is not <hi>per conſilium,</hi> as from one more wiſe than himſelf counſelling him, he is one of the <hi>Domus judicii,</hi> as ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> call the Trinity, one of the Three who fit in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together in Heaven: Here is no local motion, which cannot be in an immenſe one, but an excellent manifeſtation. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">De Trin. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>illuc mittitur ubi erat,</hi> is ſent thither where it was; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent, he is there in ſuch ſort as he was not; he is preſent there, <hi>novo modo,</hi> in a new manner, where he was not ſo preſent; he appears there in gracious operations,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60571:102"/>where he did not ſo appear; he is raiſing up a new creature, or actuating the graces, or letting out his glory in ſome ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural work; but this is not all that is in miſſion; this may be in a coming: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſaid to <hi>come,</hi> but never ſaid to be <hi>ſent:</hi> there is therefore ſomewhat more in miſſion; the Spirit doth not only operate, but it operates <hi>ſecundum originem;</hi> as he ſubſiſts from the Father and the Son, ſo he operates from them; as he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the manner of ſubſiſting, ſo he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the manner of operating: He is therefore ſaid to be ſent by the Father and Son, becauſe he ſubſiſts and operates from them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond expreſſion is the <hi>giving of the Spirit.</hi> This in ſome reſpect differs from the former; miſſion imports a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the perſon ſent from the Sender; <hi>giving</hi> imports the free bounty of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in communicating ſomething. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did not ſend himſelf, for he did not proceed from himſelf; but he may and doth give himſelf, becauſe he is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> and may communicate himſelf as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. In <hi>giving,</hi> a thing is communicated <hi>ad utendum vel fruendum,</hi> to be uſed or enjoyed. The Spirit is communicated to Believers in his graces, and in himſelf; in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60571:103"/>his graces he is communicated to be uſed, in himſelf he is communicated to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he is now had, as he was not before, in knowledg and love; by theſe the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth in mind and heart poſſeſs him, as an object able to make every one, who hath him, happy for ever.</p>
               <p>The third expreſſion is the <hi>dwelling</hi> or <hi>inhabiting of the Spirit;</hi> he is in Believers as in his Houſe or Temple; he is there in the tokens of his ſpecial preſence; the love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance that is there, ſhew him to be the inhabitant; he hath not a more proper place here below, than an heart furniſhed with thoſe graces. Alſo, he is there as an object of inward Worſhip; there is a mind which knows him, a will which ſubjects to him, a love which embraces him, a fear which reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him; there without queſtion is a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, an holy place for him; there it is that his Honour dwelleth. But I ſhall here add no more touching this inhabitation; only it muſt be remembred, that where the Spirit dwells, there the Father and the Son dwell alſo; the bleſſed Three are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one of them cannot be ſeparated from the other; where the Spirit dwells, there dwell alſo the Father and the Son with him.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:60571:103"/>
               <p>Beſides theſe three expreſſions, there is one more, that is the <hi>operation of the Spirit; All theſe worketh one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſpirit, dividing to every man ſeverally, as he will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. Touching this, I ſhall at preſent only obſerve, that this operation doth in ſeveral reſpects fall in with the other three; as it is the operation of the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, ſo it falls in with <hi>miſſion;</hi> as it concerns the uſing the Spirit in its graces, or enjoying him in himſelf, it falls in with <hi>giving;</hi> as it relates to the tokens of his preſence, or the inward worſhip done to him, it falls in with <hi>inhabitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, In anſwer to the <hi>Quaere,</hi> it is to be conſidered, that there is a double pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; one univerſal in all things, another ſpecial in the Saints; the firſt is in reſpect of his eſſence, which is immenſe and every where; the ſecond is in reſpect of his operations, which are peculiarly here, and not there. Thoſe ſpecial operations are not every where, where the eſſence is, for the there could be no ſpecial preſence; but the eſſence is wherever thoſe are, elſe the univerſal preſence would fail. When <hi>Vorſtius</hi> ſaid, That God was in the Saints, <hi>per gratioſam praeſentiam,</hi> by a gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; <hi>Piſcator</hi> notes, That there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60571:104"/>ther preſence, namely a ſubſtantial one; <hi>Operatio Dei a ſubſtantiâ divelli non poteſt,</hi> the operation of God cannot be divided from his eſſence. When <hi>Crellius</hi> ſaith, that we live and move, not in the Divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in his virtue and efficacy; the Learned <hi>Mareſius</hi> anſwers him, <hi>Inepta eſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio inter virtutem &amp; ſubſtantiam, illa hanc praeſentem ſupponit, Deus nuſquam ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur viſi eſſentialiter praeſens;</hi> It is a fooliſh thing to oppoſe the Virtue of God to his Subſtance; <hi>that</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>this</hi> preſent; God no where operates unleſs he be eſſentially preſent: Thus he. To me it is plain, that wherever there is a work of God, there he is eſſentially preſent; for his Immenſity hath no ſtint: we cannot ſay, it goes hither and no further. His Power, which reaches every work, is not diſtinct from his Eſſence, nor can no more reach beyond it, than a thing can exceed it ſelf. Theſe things may give ſome light to the point in hand; the Spirit is very God; his ſpecial preſence is not every where, where his eſſential one is; but his eſſential preſence is every where, where his ſpecial one is: his eſſential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is that, without which there could be no ſpecial one at all; his ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is that, in which the eſſential one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſome excellent operation. When
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60571:104"/>the Spirit is communicated to Believers,<note place="margin">Eſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Sanctus in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis, non tantùm, ut in omnibus rebus, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitate eſſentiae, ſed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiâ gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectorum. <hi>Par.</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> there is not meerly an eſſential preſence, but an eſſential preſence, and a ſpecial ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration waiting on it; ſuch as He, who is every where, puts forth no where but in Believers; there is not a meer ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but an actuous vigorous one, ſuch as diſcovers it ſelf in excellent ſupernatural operations; he is not here moving upon the waters to bring forth an outward ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world; but he is moving upon the heart to bring forth a ſpiritual one, a glorious new creature, in which more of himſelf appears than in all other things beſides: and when it is brought forth, he ſweetly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in upon it by motions, impulſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, to actuate the holy principles, to make the ſpicy graces flow out; to quicken, ſtrengthen, and enlarge the ſoul to every good work; and all this againſt the bias and contradiction of the corrupt fleſh, which, however croſs and repugnant it be, is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently overborn and overſet by his excellent preſence. At laſt he ſeals up the Believer, marks him out for his own, irradiates him with the beams of his favour, and ſheds the ſweetneſs of his incomparable love in his heart; and, which is much to be obſerved, he doth in all theſe glorious appearances operate intimately and immediately; he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60571:105"/>penetrates into the inmoſt ſpirit, and is more intimate to it, than that is to it ſelf; he operates not only by an immediation of virtue, but by an immediation of eſſence; for his virtue is not diſtinct from his eſſence: Thus there is a communication of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, an excellent, operative, intimate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with Believers, as if he were a kind of ſoul to them, to quicken them unto every good work. But alas! how ſhort are our thoughts in this point! how little a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it do we know! The Maſter of the Sentences out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> aſſerts, That we cannot comprehend how God is every where; much leſs can we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how he, who is every where, is in a ſpecial manner in Believers. I verily think, that thoſe Phraſes of Scripture, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Spirit to be communicated to them, have in them a myſtery much deeper than we can dive into: I ſhall therefore make no further anſwer to the <hi>Quaere,</hi> it is enough for me to ſay, with <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> That the inhabitation of the Holy Trinity in us,<note place="margin">De Perſ. Chriſt.</note> is <hi>non localis, ſed immenſa, non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibilis cogitatione, ſed venerabilis fide;</hi> not local, but immenſe; not comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thought, but venerable in Faith. I conclude with that of <hi>Zanchy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De trib. El. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

               <p>The next thing, which comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this diſcourſe, is the Operations of the Spirit. I touched upon this before, but now I will ſpeak a little more to it. It's true, theſe Operations, being among the <hi>opera ad extra,</hi> are common to the whole Trinity, yet in Scripture they are in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner attributed to the Spirit; the reaſon of which is, becauſe of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is among the perſons in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity: the Father is of himſelf, <hi>fons Deitatis,</hi> the fountain of the Deity; the Son is from the Father, <hi>lumen de lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> light of light; the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son; he proceeds by an eternal ſpiration from both of them. And as is the order of ſubſiſting, ſo is the order of operating; the Father operates from himſelf; the Son from the Father; the Holy Spirit from both: Hence in the three great Works of God; Creation, which is the firſt riſe of things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is in a ſpecial manner attributed to the Father. Redemption, which helps up
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60571:106"/>a poor fallen creature, is in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner attributed to the Son. Sanctification, which perfects the redeemed, is in a ſpecial manner attributed to the Holy Spirit. Hence in the great Work of Salvation; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laid the counſel and platform of it; the Son carries on the work in a middle mediating way; the Holy Spirit, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his place, in order conſummates it by working Faith, and all other Graces: But this is only by the way. In treating of theſe Operations, I ſhall note two things; that is, what is in them of reſpect to union with Chriſt, and what is in them of reſpect to the Inhabitation of the Spirit; or, which is all one, to the Inhabitation of the whole Sacred Trinity.</p>
               <p>The firſt Operation of the Spirit in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is this; He forms all holy Graces in them; he draws the very Picture of Chriſt upon them, in humility, love, meekneſs, mercy, goodneſs, heavenlineſs, patience: this operation is requiſite upon a double account: One, that Chriſt may have a ſeed; the Father promiſed him a ſeed; he himſelf merited one; yet a ſeed he could not have, unleſs the Spirit did work theſe Graces, which make us to bear a reſemblance of him. Another, that God might have a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; under the Old Teſtament he had an
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60571:106"/>outward Temple, but even then he would have an inward one, a Sanctuary in the heart; under the New Teſtament he had a Temple in the humane nature of Chriſt; but even in that he aimed to have a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in men; but this could not be, unleſs the Spirit did come and turn the heart into an holy place for him.</p>
               <p>As touching this Operation, the holy Graces may be conſidered under a double notion, either as they make us to have one common nature with Chriſt; and thus they import union with him: or elſe as they are tokens of the divine Preſence: and thus they import the Inhabitation of God in us.</p>
               <p>Theſe Graces make us to have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature with Chriſt: and thus they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port union with him; there is, as the learned <hi>Camero</hi> obſerves, a double union, one <hi>ab uno communi ſimpliciter,</hi> from one common nature ſimply conſidered: thus all men are united, there being one humane nature in them: another <hi>ab uno communicato,</hi> from one nature communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: thus a Father and a Son are united, the Son having the ſame nature communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the Father. To apply this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Firſt, Believers have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humane nature with Chriſt; not only
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60571:107"/>in that large ſenſe, in which all men have the ſame nature with him; but in a more ſtrict ſenſe peculiar to believers only; <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one,</hi> Hebr. 2.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of one, not of one God: ſo Angels alſo are not of one <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo wicked men alſo are, but of one nature and condition: Chriſt hath an humane nature ſanctified by the Spirit, and ſo have Believers: this is one peculiar thing in which he and they meet; there is no other holy fleſh in all the world, but what is in him and them: This tells us, that they are ſo united to him in one common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as no other creature in Heaven or Earth is. Angels are not ſo; they are holy, but not fleſh; unregenerate men are not ſo, they are fleſh, but not holy; Believers only have, as Chriſt hath, an humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſanctified by the Spirit. Further, which advances the Union, they have this ſanctified nature from him; <hi>we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5.30. In this ſanctified nature there are two things; a carnal ſubſtance, and an holy quality; as to the carnal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he is of <hi>our fleſh, and of our bones;</hi> he did partake of fleſh and blood with us: As to the holy quality, we are of <hi>his fleſh, and of his bones;</hi> by him we are partakers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60571:107"/>of the divine nature: Thus believers are joyned to him, as to the Fountan of their Sanctity; their holy Graces all hang upon him, as beams upon the Sun. If the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> had been asked, What part have you in the Lord? they would have ſhewed the pattern of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. If Believers be asked, What part have you in Chriſt? they can ſhew forth their holy Graces. Theſe are Copies drawn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him the great Samplar of Holineſs; nay, they are drawn by him, by the finger of his own Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, Theſe Graces are tokens of the divine Preſence, and ſo import the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God in us: theſe are tokens of the divine Preſence. When nature exceeds it ſelf, and riſes above its own level, as the Sea did, when the waters were as a Wall to <hi>Iſrael</hi> on both hands, it is a ſure ſign that God is there. When poor lapſed men are lifted up above their natural ſelf, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated into a divine Life (as it always is, when the holy Graces are wrought in them) it is a ſure ſign that God is there of a truth. Humane nature cannot of it ſelf aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſphere of Grace, only a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power can do ſuch a thing. Theſe Graces are ſuch tokens of Preſence, that, where-ever they are, there God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60571:108"/>In the old Temple there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tokens of Preſence; ſuch as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> the Ark with the Tables in it; the Lamps, the fire from Heaven, and the Holy of Holies were. Hence it is ſaid, that God did dwell in it; but in Believers there are better tokens of Preſence than thoſe; if we look to the intrinſecal value of things, the breaſt-plate of Faith and Love is before the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> the Law in the heart exceeds the Tables in the Ark; an illuminated mind is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than outward Lamps; an holy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of affections, is more valuable than the fire from Heaven; a pure heart is above any outward Oracle; thoſe tokens in the Temple were material things, a-kin in the matter of them to this lower world; the Sanctuary it ſelf was but a worldly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; but theſe Graces are ſpiritual things, their birth are as high as Heaven: Believers; in whom they are, are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual houſe for God to dwell in: thoſe were typical tokens, made ſuch by meer inſtitution, without which they would be but as other parts of matter; but theſe are real tokens, in their own nature bearing the very image and reſemblance of God himſelf; where theſe are, there God dwells in an eminent manner: the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60571:108"/>habitation of God in the Saints, is a middle thing, between the hypoſtatical dwelling of the Godhead in Chriſt, and the typical dwelling of it in the Temple; it is much higher than all types and ſhadows; and in excellency next unto God in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The next Operation of the Spirit in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is this: He actuates their holy Graces; he moves the new Creature by divine Influences: there is an effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every part of it: Love in the Spirit, as it is ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8. and other Graces in the Spirit: all of them go forth in the power of that Spirit which formed them at firſt.</p>
               <p>As touching this Operation, the Spirit may be conſidered either as the principle and firſt mover that actuates theſe Graces; and this ſpeaks union with Chriſt: or elſe as the <hi>terminus</hi> or ultimate object of theſe Graces actuated; and this ſpeaks the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God in us.</p>
               <p>The Spirit is the principle or firſt mover that actuates theſe Graces: and this ſpeaks union with Chriſt; the Spirit, which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, falls down upon believers to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Graces in them; Believers are all one body, and, as one body, they have one ſpirit in them from Chriſt the Head;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60571:109"/>they are all one new man in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. Though the Apoſtle there ſpeak of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet he ſaith not, <hi>one people;</hi> but, which is more emphatical, <hi>one new man in Chriſt:</hi> they are one new man, becauſe, as one man, they are acted by one ſpirit; they are one new man in Chriſt, becauſe the Holy Spirit, which is upon him, is that one Spirit which acts them; the Sons of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are acted and moved by the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. That Spirit, which anointed the humane nature of Chriſt the natural Son, falls down upon the adopted ones, to act and move them: Actuation by one ſpirit proves, that they are in intimate union with him; that they are indeed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical parts and members of him, who acts and moves them by his own Spirit. This may be illuſtrated by that in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when the wheels went as the living creatures did, and were lifted up as they were; it was plain, that there were ſome inviſible bands between them; <hi>the ſpirit of the living creature was in the wheels,</hi> verſ. 21. In like manner, when believers ſhew forth the virtues of Chriſt, and walk as he walked; it is very plain, that they are in near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him; the Spirit doth act them in ways of conformity to him,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60571:109"/>who as an Head is joyned unto them. That phraſe, of <hi>walking in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.6. points out a walking not meerly after his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and command, but in his power and ſpirit, as becomes thoſe who have received him, and are united to him.</p>
               <p>Again, The Spirit is the <hi>terminus,</hi> or ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object of theſe graces actuated: and this ſpeaks the Inhabitation of God in us. As theſe Graces come from God as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo they terminate in him as the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object. Holy fear terminates in his Majeſty and Greatneſs. Faith terminates in his Truth and Mercy. Love terminates in his Goodneſs and Excellency. Every Grace moves to him as its great Center. Where theſe Graces are actuated, there an Honour, an inward Worſhip is done to him; where that is in truth, there he hath a Temple in the heart, and objectively dwells there as in an holy place. Hence <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, that God is in the Saints, <hi>ſicut cognitum in cognoſcente &amp; amatum in amante;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pars, q.</hi> 43. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.</note> as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject known is in the knower, and an object loved is in the lover; by knowledg and love a man, <hi>attingit ad ipſum Deum,</hi> reaches to God himſelf; his heart becomes a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for the Holy One. This is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple which the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60571:110"/>gloried in.<note place="margin">Nonne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrâ dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candus eſt mente? in noſtro imo conſecran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus eſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore? —li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia bonus animus, pura mens, ſinceracon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia. <hi>Min.

                  </note> When <hi>Pagans</hi> objected againſt them, that they had no Temples, no Altars, no Sacrifices; they made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they had all within, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in mental Conſecrations, in a pure mind and heart. What was ſaid of the Temple, that may be ſaid of a Pious ſoul; There is Gods Name; there he is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and ſanctified; there he dwells as in a ſanctuary or holy place.</p>
               <p>The next Operation of the Spirit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is this: He preſerves believers in their ſpiritual being; he bears up their graces by continual influences, that they fail not in the way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>As touching this Operation, Believers are preſerved either as Members of Chriſt; and this ſhews union: or as Temples of God, and this ſhews Inhabitation.</p>
               <p>Believers are preſerved as Members of Chriſt; and this ſhews union. <hi>Adam</hi> fell, Angels fell, but Believers are preſerved; in themſelves they are but poor weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; without are temptations, within corruptions; yet they ſtand: there is but a little Oyl in the Cruſe; a ſmall ſtock of grace in the heart, yet it fails not; they have many wants, yet never become bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. This tells us, that they are not alone,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60571:110"/>but in union with Chriſt; they are, what Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency were not, joyned to a Mediator, mighty to ſave: Weakneſs here is in conjunction with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Power is made perfect in weakneſs; there is in them one greater than he that is in the world; nay, than the corruption in the heart; their little ſtock of grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon infinite treaſures; their many wants are ſupplied out of infinite fulneſs: this preſervation declares union.</p>
               <p>Again, Believers are preſerved as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God: and this ſhews Inhabitation; they are in the midſt of winds, ſtorms, temptations, corruptions, wants, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, yet they fall not: This tells us, that God hath a Temple in them; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant bears them up; he is in the midſt of them; they ſhall not be moved; his eyes and his heart are upon them to protect them; he will not ſuffer his habitation to be blown down in a ſtorm, or to be undermined by Sin and Satan, or to run to ruine through want or weakneſs: This preſervation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Inhabitation.</p>
               <p>The laſt Operation of the Spirit in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is this: He ſeals up Believers; he witneſſes their adoption; he ſheds abroad the Love of God in their hearts. I inſtance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60571:111"/>in this, not that it is ſo in all Believers, but that it is ſo in ſome.</p>
               <p>As touching this Operation, theſe favours are afforded to Believers either as Members of Chriſt; and this imports union: or as Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Inhabitation.</p>
               <p>Theſe favours are afforded to them as Members of Chriſt; and this imports uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>After that ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> Eph. 1.13. Firſt there is Faith, and then Sealing; Firſt men are Members of Chriſt, and then they are irradiated with the beams of divine Favour; there are great favours promiſed to Gods People; he dwells in the humble; he is ſeen in the pure heart; his ſecret is with them that fear him; his countenance doth behold the upright: but all theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are communicated to them as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt. It's true, the Graces, to which theſe promiſes are made, are in their own nature and intrinſecal goodneſs grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and acceptable unto God; but, becauſe they are defective, and dwelling under the ſame roof with inherent corruption, which taints and ſoils them in their going forth into act; therefore they are favoured and accepted in us as being members of Chriſt;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60571:111"/>and having an intereſt in his glorious ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is able to cover all our ſpots and imperfections; it is Chriſt, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Article is doubled, that Son, that beloved, in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is infinitely pleaſed; we are beloved only as parts of him.</p>
               <p>Again, Theſe favours are afforded to them as Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; and this imports Inhabitation. In the outward Temple God did make himſelf known, much more doth he do ſo in the inward Sanctuary; I mean, in a pure heart: there he ſheds abroad his Love, and lets out his Glory; there he dwells and walks as in a place of pleaſure and delight.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the other Bond of Union, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Chapter, the order of things touching this union ſtands thus. It was the great deſign of God to raiſe up a Church to himſelf out of the ruines of the fall; his heart was more ſet upon this, than upon all the world beſides To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this, the Son of God leaves his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſom, and comes down into our fleſh; in it he ſatisfied Juſtice, and merited to have a body gathered in, and anointed with that Holy Spirit, which operated in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60571:112"/>the uniting and ſanctifying of his own humane nature. Upon account of this ſatisfaction and merit, the Holy Spirit comes down; and not only propoſes the Goſpel to men, but operates in them firſt Faith, the grace of Union; and then, in a ſecond inſtant of nature, all other graces which may make them meet Members of Chriſt, and Temples of the Holy Ghoſt. And after this is done, he carries on the work by continual influences upon Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, quickning and preſerving their Graces, dwelling in them, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Seals of the myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion are Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Baptiſm is a Seal of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, not to all, but to Believers. Some Infants are in their infancy in union with Chriſt; ſome come to it afterwards: ſome never attain to it. The Lords Supper is a Seal to confirm and exhibit Chriſt to us. The preſence of Chriſt in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is not a corporal one. The Bread and Wine are not (as the Papiſts ſay) turned into his Body and Blood. His Body and Blood are not (as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay) in, with, and under the Bread and Wine. The preſence of Chriſt is Spiritual. He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objectively to our Faith, and virtually in the communicated Spirit. Alſo the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt is not oral, but ſpiritual.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving treated of the bonds of this Union; I now proceed to the Seals of it, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the Sacrament of Initiation; the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the Sacrament of Nutrition. Baptiſm is the firſt entrance into Gods Family; the Supper is the ſpiritual Banquet, unto which the baptized, after waſhing, paſs to feed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60571:113"/>upon Chriſt there: both of them are Seals of union with him.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is not, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it to be, a <hi>nude</hi> rite, but an obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive one; it is not a meer picture of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace, but a Seal of it. Circumciſion was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith; Baptiſm, which ſucceeds in the room of it, can be no leſs.<note place="margin">

Nazian.</note> In man there is a body and a ſoul: to anſwer both, there is in Baptiſm an outward part and an inward one; the outward part is water, which cleanſes the body; the inward part is Chriſt, who by his Blood and Spirit cleanſes the Soul: in both cleanſings, union is requiſite. Water, unleſs applied, cleanſes not the Body; Chriſt, unleſs applied, cleanſes not the Soul. Where Baptiſm is in the right uſe, there is a ſeal of union with Chriſt, who communicates the ſpiritual cleanſing to thoſe who are in him as parts of his myſtical body: Hence are thoſe Phraſes in Scripture touching bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſons; they are baptized into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. So united to him, as to be in him; they are baptized into one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. So united to him, as to be parts of his myſtical body; they have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. So united to him, as a man is to a garment; his ſatisfaction covers them, his Spirit adorns them with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60571:113"/>holy Graces, they are in Baptiſm buried with him, and riſen with him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. So united to him, that they have the power of his death in mortification, and the power of his reſurrection in a Divine life; the one is notably adumbrated in the baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal immerſion into the Water; the other in the eduction out of it: Thus Baptiſm is a ſeal to confirm Chriſt with his benefits to us. But this is not all; it is alſo a ſeal to convey him with his benefits to us. Hence in Scripture, it is for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. It is the Laver of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. Hence in the Fathers it is called, the inveſtiture of Chriſtianity, the genital Water; the ſpiritual Nativity; the divine Generation, with the like; which import, that it is a ſacred Medium, by which divine Grace is communicated to us; only it is to be remembred, that Baptiſm doth not this <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> out of the work done; it is not the Phyſical cauſe of Grace, but the Moral; it is Idolatry to imagine, that a meer creature ſhould phyſically, by its own intrinſecal virtue, cauſe ſuch a thing as Regeneration, which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for God to do; we are all apt to be led by Senſe rather than by Faith; we had much rather have Grace incloſed in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble element, than be in a dependance upon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60571:114"/>God for it; but Grace is not in Baptiſm as Wine is in a Veſſel; it is not inſiſtent in the Water, but aſſiſtent; it lodges not by the way in the element, but comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the eternal fountain: In the right uſe of Baptiſm, it never is wanting; but,<note place="margin">In Eſay. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> hath it, <hi>Homo tantùm aquam tribuit, Deus autem Spiritum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi> Man only gives the Water, God gives the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is a ſeal of union with Chriſt; only the <hi>Quaere</hi> is, to whom it is ſo? In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, I ſhall ſpeak a little; firſt touching the Baptiſm of adult perſons, then touching the Baptiſm of Infants.</p>
               <p>As touching the Adult; Baptiſm is a ſeal of union not to all, but to Believers only. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, that faith is neceſſary in all Sacraments,<note place="margin">In ſent. lib. <hi>4.</hi> d. <hi>3.</hi> qu. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> eſpecially in Baptiſm; <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam Baptiſmus eſt janua Sacramentorum, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut fides eſt janua virtutum;</hi> becauſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the gate of Sacraments, as Faith is the gate of virtues: Baptiſm is the ſeal of the Covenant, therefore it appertains to thoſe who by Faith are within it. It is clear in Scripture, that Faith is pre-required to Baptiſm; <hi>They that gladly received the word, were baptized,</hi> Acts 2.41. <hi>When they believed Philip, they were baptized,</hi> Acts 8.12. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60571:114"/>thou maiſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. Anciently, before Baptiſm, Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories were put unto the perſon to be baptized, and anſwers made by him in this manner; <hi>Renuncias Satanae? Renuncio. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis in Chriſtum? Credo.</hi> Doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Satan? I renounce him. Doſt thou believe in Chriſt? I believe. Hence <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Reſur.</note> 
                  <hi>Anima non lavatione, ſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſione ſancitur;</hi> the Soul is eſtabliſhed not by waſhing but by anſwering. In the due uſe of Sacraments there muſt be an hand on both ſides; <hi>manus Dei offerentis,</hi> the hand of God offering; and <hi>manus fidei accipientis,</hi> the hand of faith receiving; though a Sacrament hath its eſſential inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, though there be a real offer on Gods part, yet without a receiving-Faith, there is <hi>Sacramentum ſine re,</hi> a ſign without Grace. Were Faith always preſent, the Grace as well as the Sign would ever be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but Faith being abſent, nothing but the meer Sign paſſes to the receiver. Hence the Scripture diſtinguiſheth, touching Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, between that in the fleſh, and that in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. and touching Baptiſm, between the putting away the filth of the fleſh, and the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. The Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not, as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60571:115"/>other Nations, uncircumciſed in fleſh, yet were they uncircumciſed in heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized with Water, but not with the Holy Ghoſt; for he was in the gall of bitterneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13, 23. Believers are the men, to whom Baptiſm is a ſeal of union, they are in truth baptized into Chriſt and into one body, while others are ſo in ſhew and appearance only; they do indeed put on Chriſt, while others, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Contr.

They are buried with Chriſt, and riſen with him; feeling his death in their mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his reſurrection in their Divine Life. Baptiſm is for the remiſſion of ſins, but it is to thoſe who by Faith are capable of it; it is a Laver of regeneration, as the Goſpel is the Power of God to Salvation, not to all, but to Believers.</p>
               <p>As touching Infants, the Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> require Faith not only in the Adult,<note place="margin">Synopſ. Theo. de Baptiſmo.</note> but in Infants too, in order to Baptiſm. Infants may be put into three ranks: Some Infants are in their infancy in union with Chriſt; they have Faith in the ſeed, though not in the fruit; Grace in the gift, though not in the uſe; they have the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60571:115"/>Spirit dwelling in them,<note place="margin">Auſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. <hi>57.</hi>
                  </note> and are a part of his Temple, though they know him not: Neither needs this ſeem ſtrange, it is very reaſonable to believe, that a ſupernatural power may do as much as a natural one; the Image of God, which, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, would have paſſed to Infants by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural generation, may well be derived to them by ſpiritual regeneration. It's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands, that ſome Infants at leaſt enter into life eternal; But what? do they do ſo unjuſtified, unſanctified? Surely no, in Heaven there is not ſo much as the guilt of one unremitted ſin; thoſe Infants, who go thither, muſt be juſtified; if they be juſtified, they muſt have Faith and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; Faith, becauſe juſtification is by it. The Scripture knows not two ways of juſtification, one by Faith, another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; Sanctification, becauſe Juſtification is never ſeparate from it; <hi>But you are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, but you are juſtified,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Theſe twins of Grace can never be parted; where the juſtifying blood is ſprinkled, there the ſanctifying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is communicated; where the binding guilt of ſin is diſſolved, there the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpot is done away; both are to be found in thoſe Infants that are ſaved. Hence the Fathers in the <hi>Milenitan</hi> Council, <hi>Can.</hi> 2.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60571:116"/>do ſay, That Infants are baptized, <hi>in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum remiſſionem, ut in eis regeneratione mundetur, quod generatione traxerunt,</hi> for the remiſſion of ſin, that, that in them may be cleanſed in regeneration, which they drew in generation: Here they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both, remiſſion and regeneration in them. Again, In Heaven there is not, there cannot be the leaſt ſpot of pollution. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which go thither, muſt be ſanctified; without the new birth there is no entry, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. Without holineſs no ſeeing of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. Hence it appears that Infants have ſanctifying graces; to theſe Baptiſm doth immediately ſeal union.</p>
               <p>Some Infants, though baptized, are not in their infancy in union with Chriſt; but the work of Grace comes afterwards; both Baptiſms are not always together, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not always cleanſe in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Water doth: The virtue of Baptiſm is not always immediately, but it follows us, as the waters of the Rock did the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> in ſome the effect is earlier, in ſome later; theſe Infants are ſealed from the moment of Faith, not of Baptiſm; their Baptiſm doth point at a future union, but it ſeals not an actual one where it is not, but where it is.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:60571:116"/>
               <p>Some Infants, though baptized, never are in union with Chriſt; ſome Divines conceive that all baptized Infants are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, but common obſervation oppoſes this; multitudes there are of Infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, who at years of underſtanding ſhew forth nothing at all of a Divine principle; Reaſon and Will appear, but nothing of Grace. It may be reaſonably expected in regenerate perſons, that the Seed of God ſhould ſpring up, that the ſupernatural principles ſhould come forth into act in ſome meaſure; but when there is no print or footſtep of Grace, no dye or tincture of it in the life, it cannot well be imagined, that there is any ſuch thing as regeneration in them: To ſuch Infants as theſe, Baptiſm doth not ſeal union.

In this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance we eat the fleſh and drink the blood of Chriſt; we dwell in him and he in us; a very intimate union there is between him and us; only it muſt be remembred, that union is not ſealed to all, but to Believers: Faith is requiſite, that we may partake not meerly of the outward elements, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There is an expreſs command to feed on the elements; and an implied one, to feed on Chriſt; all Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers can do the firſt, but only Believers can
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60571:117"/>do the ſecond: what we do in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we are to do in remembrance of Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 24, 25. Not only in an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical remembrance which is common to all Receivers; but in a fiducial one, which is proper to Believers. The unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver doth not diſcern the Lords body, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. but Believers have a ſpiritual eye for it; to them Chriſt is communicated. Others have the elements only, <hi>panem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, non panem Dominum;</hi> the bread of the Lord, not the Bread the Lord. Were I for Tranſubſtantiation at all, I ſhould think it reaſonable to be of their mind, who, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates, held,<note place="margin">De Euch. lib. <hi>3:</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> that only that part of the Bread, which the pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, was turned into the Body of Chriſt: It is to me without doubt, that impious men do not receive it or feed upon it. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.54. Hence that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

               <p>The great thing in this Sacrament is the eating of Chriſt; eating cannot be of a thing abſent, it is an unmoveable axiom; that which is eaten, muſt be ſome way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60571:118"/>I ſhall therefore, firſt diſcourſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and then ſpeak touching the eating of him. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> do both aſſert a corporal preſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, but upon different grounds; the one upon account of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation of elements; the other upon account of an ubiquity communicated to the humane nature of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> aſſert ſuch a preſence upon account of a Tranſubſtantiation of elements; they explain it thus, thoſe words, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood,</hi> are conſecratory and operative; by virtue of them, and in the laſt inſtant of pronouncing them, the Bread and Wine are turned into the Body and Blood of Chriſt; the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remains no longer; but under the accidents thereof, are the very Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I ſhall conſider the words, <hi>this is my body; (this)</hi> is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>(is)</hi> the copula, <hi>(my body)</hi> the predicate; touching the predicate, it is on all hands granted to be the Body of Chriſt; the only queſtion is in the two other.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>(this)</hi> imports clearly the Bread; this appears by the precedent words: <hi>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60571:118"/>brake it, and gave unto them, ſaying, this is my body, Luke</hi> 22.19. What did he ſay was his body, but that which he gave to his Diſciples? what did he give unto them, but what he brake? what brake he, but what he took? And doth not the Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, that he took Bread? Of the Bread therefore he ſaid, This is my body; the order of the words ſhews it to be bread; this will more appear if we compare theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> with thoſe which are a fair commentary on them, <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. In the one we have the word <hi>(this),</hi> in the other the <hi>bread</hi> in expreſs terms; in the one we have the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> in the other the <hi>communion of it:</hi> In both, <hi>Bread</hi> is the thing ſpoken of, as a thing diſtinct from the <hi>body,</hi> of which it is the <hi>communion.</hi> If the word <hi>(this)</hi> be not bread, what can we make of it? Is it the accidents of the Bread? The <hi>Greek</hi> word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, imports not accidents, but a ſubſtance; accidents are not a body, neither are theſe converted, but remain. Is it the Body of Chriſt? That is not in the Euchariſt till all the words be uttered, it is not there at the pronouncing of the firſt word <hi>(this);</hi> the Propoſition is not identical, the words run not thus,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60571:119"/>my body is my body; neither, if they did, could they any more work a converſion, than a thing can be turned into it ſelf. Is it <hi>an ſubſtantia vaga,</hi> an indefinite ſubſtance, ſuch as is neither Bread, nor the Body of Chriſt? This is ſuch a vagrant, that all the world knows not where to find it: Chriſt did not take, bleſs, break, give an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſubſtance, but the Bread: It remains therefore, that the Bread is the thing point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. The words in effect are thus; the Bread is the Body of Chriſt; and then, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth,<note place="margin">De Euch. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> the words muſt be taken tropically, or elſe they are plainly abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The Copula <hi>(is)</hi> doth in Propoſitions import ſuch a conjunction, as the ſubject and predicate coupled together are capable of; when it ſtands between the ſign and the thing ſignified, it is not to be taken eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, but ſignificatively; the ſign is not the very thing, but a ſign. In Scripture we read not of a ſign turned into the thing ſignified, but we ordinarily find the name of the thing ſignified given to the ſign: <hi>Circumciſion is the covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.10. That is, a ſign of it, as the next verſe tells us; <hi>The Lamb is the paſſover,</hi> Exod. 12.11. that is, a ſign of it. The Cup, that is, the Wine in in it, is the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> 1 Cor.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60571:119"/>11.25. that is, it is Sacramentally ſuch; after the ſame manner the Bread is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt; that is, it is ſignificatively ſuch: this is the plain natural interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words.<note place="margin">

               <p>Two things may be noted touching the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>The one is this; It is a Doctrine croſs to the deſcription of the Euchariſt which we have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. The Bread was not bleſſed that it might be deſtroyed; nor given to be eaten, that it might ceaſe to be before it was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Never did God put forth his miraculous power to make his command impoſſible, ſuch as the eating of Bread, which is not, muſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60571:120"/>needs be; in thoſe words <hi>(this is my body)</hi> in which, if in any, Tranſubſtantiation may be found, there is no imperative word, no mention at all of converſion, which yet, being a very wonderful thing, would in all reaſon, if it were true, be fully open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is not only ſaid, <hi>this is my body,</hi> but it is added, <hi>which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.</hi> In the Euchariſt Chriſts Body is not conſidered as a glorious Body, but as broken and crucified; neither is there only his Body, but the memorial of it; And how ſhould there be a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bread into the Body? A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of it into the glorious Body, doth not ſute with the Sacrament; a converſion of it into a broken crucified Body doth not ſute with a ſtate of glory; or, if there were a converſion, how ſhould there be a memorial? the Bread, which is not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a memorial of the Body, neither can the Body be a memorial of it ſelf: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it is no leſs than three times called Bread, to aſſure us, that it is Bread after conſecration, as well as before.</p>
               <p>The other is this: It is a Doctrine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very great abſurdities; it puts things into ſuch a poſture as here follows.</p>
               <p>Here's a Sacrament without a ſign. It is eſſential to a Sacrament, that there be an
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60571:120"/>earthly part as well as an heavenly; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the body, as well as for the ſoul: but here's a Sacrament of meer accidents; no Bread, no Wine to figure out the body and blood of Chriſt; no corporal nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to ſignifie a ſpiritual one.</p>
               <p>Here's accidents without a ſubject; the bread vaniſheth, but the accidents remain and face our ſenſes, yet they ſtand all alone without a ſubſtance to inhere in; under their roof is no leſs than the body of Chriſt, yet they lean upon nothing.</p>
               <p>Here's a thing made, which before was made; which is all one, as if a Father ſhould beget a Son already begotten, or an Architect build an houſe already built; the body of Chriſt, which was before the Converſion, is produced by turning the bread into it; he that was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin, is made again by pronouncing a few words; to make that which is made, is impoſſible. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to ſalve this, ſaith,<note place="margin">De Euch. lib. <hi>3.18.</hi>
                  </note> That it is not <hi>converſio productiva, ſed adductiva;</hi> which diſtinction overturns it ſelf; if it be only adductive, it is no converſion; if Chriſt had only deſtroyed the ſubſtance of the Water, and ſet Wine, that was extant before, in the room of it, there had been no converſion; no more is there, if the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60571:121"/>bread ceaſe to be; and the body of Chriſt, that was before in being, came in the room of it: Here is no Tranſubſtantiation, but Tranſlocation only.</p>
               <p>Here's a body in many places; the body of Chriſt is intire in Heaven; it is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in the Euchariſt; it is therefore above it ſelf, below it ſelf, at a diſtance from it ſelf: all which are impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Here's a miſtake of the Senſes; the bread appears to be bread, it looks, touches, ſmells, taſtes like bread, yet it is not ſo; in other things our ſenſes are right, but in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt (in which the deſign is by ſenſe to lead our Faith to ſpiritual objects) they are in a fatal error, much leſs tolerable than if there were a miſtake about other objects; it being, not in a thing meerly natural or ſpeculative, but in a ſacred or practical ſign ordained on purpoſe to figure out and exhibit Chriſt unto us. Thus much touching the Doctrine of the Papiſts in this point.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> aſſert a corporal preſence upon account of an Ubiquity in Chriſts humane nature: They explain themſelves more fully thus. Two things may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted touching this Preſence, the Will of Chriſt, and his Power. Touching his Will, it appears in the words of Inſtitution, <hi>This
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60571:121"/>is my body;</hi> that is, in, with, and under this bread is my body; this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe of it. Touching his Power to do it, they ſay, there is an hypoſtatical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine and humane natures in Chriſt; his Hypoſtaſis is communicated to the humane nature, therefore ſo are the divine Properties, ſuch as Immenſity is; he ſits in the humane nature at the right hand of God; and that right hand is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The union of the two natures is inſeparable; therefore where his Deity is, there is his Humanity; he is everywhere God incarnate, therefore no-where excar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or out of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>In anſwer unto this, I ſhall offer ſome things.</p>
               <p>As touching the Will of Chriſt, expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> ſeem to ſtand for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Letter of the Text; but their Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a litteral one, <hi>(This)</hi> is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>(in, with, and under this)</hi> in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>(This is my body)</hi> is one thing, <hi>(in, with, and under, This is my body)</hi> is another; neither is their Interpretation true. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament as well as the Lords Supper; as in the one, the blood of Chriſt is not in, with, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water; ſo in the other, the body is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60571:122"/>not in, with and under the bread; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is alike in both Sacraments. If in the Euchariſt the body be in, with, and under the bread, then the blood is in, with, and under the wine; conſequently the blood is ſeparate from the body. There is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt now in Glory, not to ſay, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond paſſion, but as many paſſions as there are Euchariſts. It is not eaſie to imagine how the bread ſhould be broken, and the body under it, not be ſo; or how the body ſhould be broken on Earth, and at the ſame time glorious in Heaven; or how the ſame body at the ſame inſtant can be preſent in as many diſtant places as there are Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts in the world; or, if ſuch a Preſence might be, how the body coúld be finite, or indeed a body. All which ſtrange Riddles the <hi>Lutherans</hi> muſt maintain to make good their opinion.</p>
               <p>As touching the Power of Chriſt to do it, the particulars muſt be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Hypoſtaſis is communicated to the humane nature; therefore ſo are the divine Properties; ſuch as Immenſity is.<note place="margin">Theol. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. <hi>51.</hi>
                  </note> I anſwer, with the learned <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Hypoſtaſis of the Word is communicated to the humane nature; not <hi>inhaeſivè</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominativè,</hi> but <hi>ſuſtentativè:</hi> the humane nature of Chriſt is not a Perſon; it may
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60571:122"/>no more be called a perſon, than Chriſt may have two perſons; it doth not ſubſiſt, but exiſt in the perſon of the Word; there is no perſonality in it, but it is received and taken into the perſon of the Word, and the perſon of the Word doth ſtay and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain it. Hence it is evident, that the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis not being communicated to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature inheſively or denominatively, the divine Properties are not ſo communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to it, neither is there any immenſity therein. It's true, from the hypoſtatical union of the divine and humane natures in Chriſt, there doth iſſue a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a communication of Properties; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of both natures are truly and really attributed to the Perſon; the Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in both natures; both natures are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in the Perſon; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the divine nature are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the humane; for then the humane ſhould be not immenſe only, but infinite and eternal, nay, God himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the divine Properties are all one with the divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, Chriſt in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſits at Gods right hand, and that right hand is everywhere. I anſwer, This argument ſuppoſes, that the body of Chriſt is as the right hand of God is, which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60571:123"/>is utterly untrue; the right hand of God is incorporeal; is the body of Chriſt ſo? or can it be ſo, and not ceaſe to be a body? The right hand of God is infinite; is the humane nature of Chriſt ſo? or can it be ſo, and not become a God? In like manner, the right hand is everywhere; muſt the humane nature be ſo too? Scripture op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it in thoſe very Texts which mention Chriſts Seſſion. Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God; but where? It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in heavenly places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the high places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in the Heavens, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.1. The Seſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notes out his ſtate of Glory in Heaven, not his univerſal Preſence. The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt ſits on the right hand of God;</hi> and from thence preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to <hi>ſet their affections on things above, not on things on the earth,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2. But if the Seſſion note an univerſal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the Apoſtles exhortation vaniſhes into nothing. <hi>Stephen looketh up, and saw the heavens opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7.55, 56. But if the being at the right hand did point out an univerſal Preſence, what needed any looking up, or opening of Heaven to ſee him, who in his humane nature is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? Again, If the Ubiquity of Chriſts
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60571:123"/>humane nature be from his Seſſion, then it is not from the hypoſtatical Union, which was long before in the firſt moment of his Incarnation; or if it be from the hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union, then it is not from the Seſſion, which was after his Paſſion and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, the union of the two natures in Chriſt is inſeparable; therefore where his Deity is, there is his Humanity. I anſwer, There may be an union, and yet the united may not co-exiſt in all places; a Star is united to its Orb, yet the Orb is where the Star is not: The humane nature of Chriſt is united to the divine, yet the divine nature is where the humane is not; the reaſon is evident; where the united are equal, there may be a full co-exiſtence in place; but where they are unequal, as the two natures in Chriſt muſt needs be, there it cannot be ſo; the infinite nature is not put into finite ſtraits; the finite one is not ſtretcht into an infinity; the union joyns not, deſtroys the natures; the humane nature muſt have its limits, the divine can have none. Hence it appears, that the divine nature muſt needs be where the humane is not.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, Chriſt is everywhere God incarnate, no-where excarnate, or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60571:124"/>out of the fleſh. I anſwer, As to that, he is every where God incarnate; it may be taken two ways, either thus, God who is in the fleſh, is every where; and this is true, but proves not the ubiquity of the fleſh: or thus, the fleſh, in which God is, is every where; and this would make for ubiquity, but it is untrue.</p>
               <p>As to the other, He is no where excar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or out of the fleſh; he may be ſaid to be out of the fleſh two ways; either thus, The union of the natures is diſſolved, the divine nature is ſeparated from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and this never is or can be; though the divine nature be where the humane is not, yet the union remains, it being made <hi>cum</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>non cum loco,</hi> with the word, not with place; the Divine nature, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, cannot poſſibly by diſtance be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from any thing; if in the leaſt point it were ſeparated, it ſhould ceaſe to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe: or elſe thus, The Divine Nature is not ſhut up in the limits of the fleſh, but doth tranſcendently exceed them; and thus the Divine Nature is not ſo properly out of the fleſh as beyond it; according to its Infinity it is where the humane is not.

And again, The body of Chriſt is given,<note place="margin">Art. the 28.</note> taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after an heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner.

               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who caſt off this ſpiritual preſence as a fancy, do yet in explaining a corporal preſence make the notion too fine to conſiſt with the nature of a body.<note place="margin">De Euch.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not have the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt to be viſible, ſenſible, tangible; it exiſts after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Spirits, nay, it is preſent after the manner of God. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> will not have the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt to be viſible, palpable, local, circumſcribed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60571:125"/>with place; it exiſts in a ſupernatural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it is preſent <hi>praeſentiâ divinâ,</hi> by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence: Thus they, who ſlight the ſpiritual preſence, do make the corporal one ſo fine, that the body of Chriſt, after they have ſtript it of its eſſential properties, is more like a Spirit than a Body.</p>
               <p>The preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is a ſpiritual one. This is clear; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſuch as the faculty is to which the thing is preſented; the Bread and Wine (which are the outward ſymbols of the Sacrament) are preſented to our ſenſe; the Body and Blood of Chriſt (which are the inward marrow of it) are preſented to our Faith: In the former a corporal preſence is neceſſary; in the latter a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual one. Again, The preſence is ſuch as the eating is; the eating of Chriſt is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; it is (as appears in the ſixth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>John</hi>) from ſpiritual principles to a ſpiritual end; from the quickening ſpirit to life eternal: the preſence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be a ſpiritual one, that it may ſute to the eating. Further, The preſence is as the union is; the union between Chriſt and us is ſpiritual, he dwells in us by Faith, he lives in us by his Spirit; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence therefore muſt be a ſpiritual one, that it may agree with the union.</p>

               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60571:126"/>
               <p>The one is this; the body of Chriſt is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively preſent to our faith. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that before their eyes Jeſus Chriſt had been evidently ſet forth cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among them; his Croſs was at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> his glorious reſidence in Heaven; yet he is before our faith in the Goſpel, and particularly in the Euchariſt, in which, as in a ſacred Crucifix, we ſee him as it were a ſuffering for us. It is here to be noted, that there is a double exiſtence of things; the one abſolute, which is coufined to time and place; the other relative and objective, which is not ſo. The Sun in its abſolute exiſtence is in its orb; but as an object it is preſent to the eye, which ſees not meerly the viſible ſpecies, but the Sun it ſelf. The Body of Chriſt in its abſolute exiſtence is in Heaven; but as an object it is preſent to Faith, which ſees not meerly the outward figures and ſymbols in the Euchariſt, but Chriſt himſelf ſweating, bleeding, dying on a Croſs, ſatisfying Divine juſtice for ſin; which is ſuch a ſight, as makes the Soul hide in his wounds, waſh in his blood, reſt on his at onement, and triumph in his ſalvation. <hi>The phylact</hi> upon that paſſage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. enquiring how Chriſt, who was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could be ſaid to be crucified among the <hi>Galatians?</hi> Anſwers thus, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicationi
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60571:127"/>fidem praebentes perinde ac praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem vidiſtis;</hi> believing the Goſpel preached, ye ſaw him as preſent with you. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> upon that Text ſaith, it was with you <hi>quaſi apud nos omnia facta ſint,</hi> as if all things had been done with you, as if you had ſeen Chriſt hanging on the Croſs: Thus Chriſt as an object is preſent to our Faith. It's true, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, this preſence is not a real one, but in fancy and imagination only; but may that faith, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſubſiſtence of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. be called a fancy? Was it a fancy, by which <hi>Abel</hi> offered his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſacrifice? <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated into Heaven? <hi>Noah</hi> prepared an Ark? <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up his beloved <hi>Iſaac? Moſes</hi> ſaw him that is inviſible? Is it by a fancy, that we are juſtified before God? that we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World? that we are inſerted and incorporated into Chriſt? that we eat his fleſh and drink his blood? that we have him dwelling and living in our hearts? Theſe things are not done by fancy, but by faith; that ſpiritual preſence, which is to our faith, is not imaginary but real; no needleſs thing, but ſimply neceſſary to the ſpiritual eating of Chriſt unto life eternal. Without a preſence there can be no eating; without a ſpiritual preſence there can be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60571:127"/>no ſpiritual eating; that cannot be corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten which is not preſent to ſenſe; that cannot be ſpiritually eaten which is not preſent to Faith: the ſpiritual preſence therefore is ſo far from being a fancy, that it is neceſſary to that ſpiritual eating, which is neceſſary to life eternal.</p>
               <p>The other is this; The Body of Chriſt is preſent virtually, and in the Holy Spirit communicated to us. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſets out Chriſt by the Sun, the great Luminary of the world;<note place="margin">De Caenâ. Domini.</note> 
                  <hi>Totum apud ſe manens totum ſe omnibus commodat,</hi> remaining whole in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he communicates himſelf whole to all his members. His Sacred Body, which is locally in Heaven, comes down to us in healing and quickening beams, in the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence and operations of the Spirit; there goes out from it a divine virtue, which reaches down to all the Believers in the world, and upon every touch of Faith is preſent to heal them: <hi>Evigilet fides &amp; praeſtò eſt Chriſtus;</hi> let Faith awake, and Chriſt is at hand. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> a great man among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> aſſerts, that the paſſion of Chriſt operates <hi>per ſpiritualem contactum,</hi> by a ſpiritual contact. <hi>Scheckius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Pars. q.</hi> 48. <hi>art.</hi> 6.</note> a learned <hi>Lutheran.</hi> ſaith, that the Body of Chriſt is preſent with us, not locally and corporally, but ſpiritually and in Energy. But here it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60571:128"/>will be ſaid, that thus the body of Chriſt is preſent in its effect only. To which I anſwer, there is more in it than ſo; the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated is not a meer effect, but a <hi>copula</hi> or unitive bond; it operates not meerly upon believers as objects, but in them as parts of Chriſt. When the Sun lets down his rays to the earth, thoſe rays are effects, and operate upon the earth as an object; but when the head lets down the animal ſpirits to the feet, thoſe ſpirits are an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bond, and operate in them as parts of the body. Thus it is between Chriſt and Believers; the Spirit is not a meer effect, but an unitive bond; it joins them inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to Chriſt, it makes them members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, myſtical parts of him, and a kind of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants of his humane nature, not indeed hypoſtatically, but ſpiritually joined to it; the diſtance between Heaven and Earth can no more impede this conjunction, than the diſtance between the head and feet can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede that union which is between them. The Immenſe Spirit can more eaſily unite at a vaſt diſtance, then finite ſpirits can at a leſs; the humane nature of Chriſt cannot by local diſtance be ſeparated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, becauſe the Divine is Immenſe; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers cannot by local diſtance be ſeparated
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60571:128"/>from Chriſt, becauſe the uniting Spirit is Immenſe. Again, The Spirit operates not meerly upon Believers as objects, but in them as parts of Chriſt; firſt it makes them parts, and then it operates in them as ſuch: 'Two things eminently ſhew them to be parts of him, that is, his Satisfaction is imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively derived down upon them; his Spirit doth by a ſpecial preſence operate in them; in the one they are as parts covered, in the other as parts acted: That the curſe of the Law doth not ſeize upon them, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Head covers them with his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; that they walk in holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it is becauſe the Head moves and acts them by his Spirit. Thus we are in inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction with him; and ſo, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">In <hi>1</hi> Cor. cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we partake of him; his body, which is united to him hypoſtatically, is united to us myſtically; we have his fleſh in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and operating Spirit. We know his fieſh (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>Non ſecundum car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>

                  <hi>ſed ſecundum ſpiritum;</hi> not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit: his corporal preſence being gone from us, there ſucceeds a ſpiritual one in the room of it.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the eating of Chriſt. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who ſtand for a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60571:129"/>corporal preſence, are for an eating ſutable, that is, an oral one; but this is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. In the Euchariſt there is an earthly part before our ſenſe, and an heavenly one before our faith; in the one an oral eating is proper; in the other it is impoſſible, vain, nay, a very horrible thing: It is impoſſible; the body of Chriſt cannot be eaten orally without ſuffering; neither can it ſuffer while it is in glory; it would not, if torn into pieces, ſerve all the communicants in the Church; neither can it (being finite) be received intirely by all. It is alſo vain; could we take the body of Chriſt into our mouths, how ſhould it ſpiritually profit us? which way ſhould it nouriſh our Souls to life eternal? The Throat is the road of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible food, Faith is the only organ that takes in the incorruptible; a Capernatical eating is to no purpoſe. It is alſo a very horrible thing;<note place="margin">In Joh. cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theophylact,</hi> ſpeaking of eating Chriſts fleſh, ſaith, Chriſtians are not <hi>devoratores carnis,</hi> devourers of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh; but our Saviours words are to be underſtood ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Fathers were not for an oral eating,<note place="margin">De Caenâ Domini.</note> but a ſpiritual one; <hi>Non dentes ad mordendum acuimus, ſed fide ſincerâ panem ſanctum frangimus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian, We do not ſharpen our teeth to bite; but we break
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60571:129"/>the Holy Bread with a ſincere Faith.</hi> The Fathers in the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſay, That we receive the Body of Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, truly, but they mean, ſpiritually; for they call upon us to lift up our minds in Faith. St.<hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, That the true eater, who never dies, <hi>Manducat intùs, non foris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Joh. tract. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat in corde, non premit dente,</hi> eats with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not without; eats with the heart, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not with the tooth.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual eating ſtands in two or three things; it imports intimate union with Chriſt; the Bread is united to the Body, Chriſt is united to the Soul. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad fratr. in Erem. Ser. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Sacramentum illud ideò hominibus datur, ut corpus in terris capiti coadunetur;</hi> This Sacrament is therefore given to men, that the body on earth may be united to the head: It's true, Believers before they receive the Euchariſt are united to Chriſt; but in the uſe of it their union is increaſed, their faith comes to have more life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, they grow up into the head in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conjunction with, and aſſimilation to him. Again, It imports a derivation of ſtrength and life from Chriſt; Bread ſtrengthens the outward man, Chriſt the inward one; his Satisfaction ſtrengthens it againſt the fears of wrath; his Spirit ſtrengthens it unto all duties and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60571:130"/>Believers have ſome ſtrength before, but here they renew their ſtrength; they have freſh taſts and ſavours of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, high and rich anointings of the Holy Spirit; they do not only eat Chriſt, but feaſt upon him; his fleſh is as ſpiritual marrow; his blood is as celeſtial wine to cheer their inner man; his Spirit comes down upon them in further commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of grace and comfort, in pure diſcoveries of the love and kindneſs of God, which cannot but put life and vigor into their Souls. Further, It imports that this derivation of ſtrength from Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; we eat, not once or twice, but often, to repair the frail body; Believers daily feed upon Chriſt, daily derive ſtrength from him to keep up their Souls in a ſtate of Grace. Some of the Ancient Fathers interpret the daily Bread in the Lords Prayer to be no other than Chriſt; the ſuperſubſtantial Bread, which we daily feed on by Faith.<note place="margin">De Orat. Dom.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That in begging daily Bread, we beg <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem in Chriſto,</hi> a perpetuity in Chriſt. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, That in it we beg, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t a corpore Chriſti non recedamus,</hi> that we may not depart from his body. Every day we ſtand in need of Chriſt; we are not always at the Lords Table, feeding
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60571:130"/>on the elements; but upon Chriſt, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtance of the Sacrament, we are daily to feed, that we may receive ſuch a Divine vigor from him, as may preſerve our union with him.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the Seals of this union, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Priviledges of thoſe that are in Chriſt are great. Chriſts righteouſneſs is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively derived upon them, to deliver them from wrath, to intitle them to life eternal. Chriſt is their Advocate above; he pleads for them, that they may have pardon, the ſpirit, acceſs to God. They are adopted in him; as ſons they have a freedom in holy things, a continual indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from God, an heavenly inheritance. They have the Holy Spirit in them, it lives, breathes, moves, operates in them. They have communion with God; their ſervices anſwer to his call; his communications an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their ſervices. They are happy in every condition; in proſperity their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are pure; in adverſity they have God with them; and admirably appearing to them.

               <p>HAving treated of the Seals of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Union; I now come to the Priviledges of it, which are great enough, if ſeen, to attract all men unto Chriſt. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was very illuſtrious in Jewiſh Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60571:132"/>he was <hi>Circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Phariſee: Concerning zeal perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church: touching the righteouſneſs which is in the law, blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3.5, 6.

                  </gap>, an excellency of priviledges above all other to be had in Chriſt; by union with him the Apoſtle had an inward circumciſion made without hands, he became one of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtock and tribe of Chriſt, a Chriſtian ſo named from Chriſt his Head and Maſter, an heavenly <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſeparated to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, a right zealot for the Faith which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſtroyed, a perſon inveſted with a better righteouſneſs than his own, even with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of ſuch things as theſe, all other things were but as droſs in his eyes. To be in union with Chriſt, is to be a ſubject, ſpouſe, building, branch, member of his; to have the priviledges of union, is to have all the good things which the ſpiritual King, Husband, Foundation, Root, Head affords to thoſe that are joined to him: Chriſt gives himſelf to us, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all other good things. Memorable are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60571:133"/>the Words of Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> touching the crucified body of Chriſt,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. on the Lords Supper. <hi>fol.</hi> 28.</note> It was <hi>his</hi> body by <hi>his</hi> hypoſtatical and real; but it is <hi>ours</hi> by a ſpiritual and myſtical union; whatſoever fulneſs is in him, of it have we all received.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Latro, quod illa in corpore Chriſti vulnera non eſſent Chriſti vulnera, ſed Latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. <hi>Ambr.</hi> de Sancto Latrone.

                  </note> Whatſoever graces and merits flow from him as the Head, they trickle down as far as the skirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the meaneſt of his choſen. The pains of his wounds were his, but ours is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; the ſufferings of his death were his, but ours is the mercy; the ſtripes on his back were his, but the balm that iſſued from them, ours; the thorns on his head were his, but the crown is ours; the holes in his hands and ſide were his, but the blood that ran out was ours; in a word, the price was his, but the purchaſe ours. Thus that excellent man. The excellency of theſe priviledges will beſt appear by particulars; I ſhall therefore inſtance in ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>The firſt Priviledg is this; Thoſe that are in union with Chriſt, have his ſatisfactory righteouſneſs imputatively derived upon them; Chriſt obeyed unto death, the death of the Croſs, not as a private perſon, but as a Sponſor or Surety for us; he ſtood in our room, he ſuffered in our ſtead, he was a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> an head no leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to his ſeed than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:60571:133"/>was to his poſterity; as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin comes upon each one of us as ſoon as he is <hi>proles Adae,</hi> ſo Chriſts Righteouſneſs comes upon each one of us as ſoon as he is <hi>proles Chriſti.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>As by one mans diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. Hence thoſe many phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Scripture, <hi>Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs; we are the Righteouſneſs of God in him; he is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to us; his ſtripes heal us; his blood cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> All which ſhew, that his Righteouſneſs is communicated to us: this is an exceeding great priviledg. Two things will evidence this:</p>
               <p>The one is this; The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt delivers us from the curſe and wrath of God; <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt:</hi> Their being in him is a ſecurity; it is with them, as it was with thoſe Servants of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which were within when the ſtorm came; they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cover of Chriſts ſatisfaction, when the fire and brimſtone and horrible tempeſts comes down upon a Chriſtleſs world; they are in a Sanctuary in the wounds of Chriſt; Vindictive Juſtice (once ſatisfied there) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come there again for a ſecond ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; their ſin was condemned in the fleſh
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60571:134"/>of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. It was fully puniſhed there; it is not to be condemned again, or puniſhed a ſecond time in his members; no, the Apoſtle doth in that place imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately add, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </gap>, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that Chriſt made to the violated Law, becomes imputatively ours; the Law cannot demand another ſatisfaction: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. It was never meant, that the curſe ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head and members too; it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head, that the members might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: This is ſuch a priviledg, that thoſe who have it, are happy in every condition; their troubles are ſingle, and without a curſe in them; their cup is pure, and without any dregs of wrath in it; Death to them is but a dark entry into life-eternal; it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties their bodies and ſouls, but it ſeparates neither from their Head; they ſleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in a ſtate of conjunction with him; the great day of judgment need not alarum their fears; the trumpet of God doth not ſound death to them, but life; the world may be wrapt up in a winding-ſheet of flames; the Chriſtleſs inhabitants may cry to the Rocks and Mountains to fall upon them, and cover them; but Believers are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60571:134"/>ſafe with Chriſt, as members with the head; his Righteouſneſs is as a rich Robe to cover them; Chriſt will come in glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; a train of Angels will attend him; but Believers need not be afraid; being head, he will not condemn his members; being Author of his own Righteouſneſs, he will not deny the plea of it; they ſhall be for ever diſcharged from the wrath to come.</p>
               <p>The other is this; The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt intitles us unto favour and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal.</p>
               <p>It intitles us to the favour of God; Our Saviour prays to his Father for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them,</hi> John 17.26. That is, that the Fathers love might be not only towards him, but might in a meaſure be derived upon his members, in whom he is by a myſtical conjunction; the words <hi>(I in them)</hi> point out that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as the reaſon of extending love to them: God favours us as myſtical parts of Chriſt; he is with us through <hi>Immanuel;</hi> he ſhines on us in the face of Chriſt; he tells us in Scripture, that he <hi>taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that fear him;</hi> looks to a contrite Spirit, compaſſes the righteous with favour; but all this reſpect is unto
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60571:135"/>them as being in Chriſt; it is only for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in innocency, and graces in perfection to be accepted in themſelves; fallen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and defective graces muſt be accepted in and through a Mediator: Here's the priviledg of thoſe in Chriſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their defects they are favourites of Heaven; Gods eye is upon them; his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in them; his favour irradiates them; the light of his countenance is a kind of Heaven unto them.</p>
               <p>It alſo entitles us to life-eternal; Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by one righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18; not by many righteouſneſſes, but by one, which is that of Chriſt; by the ſame blood by which he entred into the holy place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12. do his members enter alſo; his blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves obſtacles, it purges away guilt, which would have barred them out of Heaven; it ſatisfies Juſtice, which would have been like a flaming ſword to keep them out of Paradiſe; neither is this all, it is a full price for Heaven, it merits all the glory above. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> therefore obſerves, that Chriſt hath a double right to Heaven, <hi>haereditate patris &amp; merito paſſionis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Vitâ. S. Vern. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> by the inheritance of his Father, and by the merit of his Paſſion: the one is enough for him, the other for us; thoſe that are in Chriſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60571:135"/>ſhall enter Heaven, and ſee the bleſſed One there; <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> This is a priviledg not fully to be known till it be enjoyed; a thing too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to be ſeen in this dark and fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting world; when we are in the region of light, and in the eternal center, then we ſhall underſtand what an heavenly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Chriſt hath made for us, and what a priviledg it is to be in union with him.</p>
               <p>Another priviledg is this; Chriſt, who ſuffered on earth for thoſe that are in him, doth intercede for them in Heaven; he is an Agent for them above, to maintain their peace and intercourſe with Heaven; he bears their Names upon his Humeral and upon his Pectoral, ſpiritually ſuſtaining, and intimately loving them; he appears in the preſence of God for them; he is their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, and pleads, though not orally, yet really, by his Blood and Righteouſneſs, that all the good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bleſſings thereby purchaſed may come down upon them; he is the Lamb that ſtands as if it were ſlain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6 His wounds and blood cry in the ears of God to be returned unto his members in pardons and graces; he, who ſatisfied ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, now pleads for grace; he, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60571:136"/>laid the foundation of Salvation, now lives to perfect the work, to ſave <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25; not by halves, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; to give our Salvation its laſt act and complement; he is a Prieſt for ever, his Sacrifice, but once offered up, is in his Interceſſion virtually continued, to perfect for ever them that are ſanctified: Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have a tree of life, bearing as many excellent fruits as Chriſt paid for in his Death. To inſtance in ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Here's a pardon for them. He, that on earth made ſatisfaction for ſin, in Heaven pleads for the pardon of it; his Blood crys, That the ſin which is ſatisfied for in the head, may not be charged upon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 John 2.1. He pleads that righteouſneſs, which, being put into the oppoſite ballance, outweighs all the ſins of his people.</p>
               <p>Here's the ſupply of the Holy Spirit given to them; he, that here below dyed to merit the communication of the Spirit, lives and intercedes above to have it done: <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> John 14.16. Our Saviour prays in the force of an infinite price, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Spirit is given to them;</hi> he lives for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60571:136"/>ever, and continues praying; therefore <hi>the Spirit abides with them;</hi> that, which he by Prayer obtains for us, by Power he confers upon us: therefore (as Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> he is ſaid to <hi>receive gifts for men,</hi> noting the fruit of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,<note place="margin">On the 110 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> fol. 438.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. And in the Apoſtle, to <hi>give gifts to men,</hi> noting the power and fulneſs of his Perſon, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which you now ſee and hear,</hi> Acts 2.33. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt never fails to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Spirit to his members.</p>
               <p>Here's an acceſs to God, a free ingreſs for them unto the Mercy-ſeat; whileſt he is at Gods right hand, none can bar them out from the divine Preſence: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That we have a great High Prieſt paſſed into the Heavens,</hi> one no leſs than the very Son of God; and withal, one as man <hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi> no leſs willing and compaſſionate, than able to help us. And from thence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Let us therefore come <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with boldneſs,</hi> with a liberty to ſpeak all our mind, <hi>unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Hebr. 4.14, 15, 16. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers need not fear to approach unto the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60571:137"/>great God; his Glory will not ſwallow them up; his Juſtice will not be a devouring fire to them; they may freely open their wants before him; their regular prayers ſhall ſurely ſpeed in Heaven; Chriſt intercedes there for them; and, which is the Eccho of that Interceſſion, the Spirit makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in their hearts; the ſucceſs therefore cannot fail: though their prayers, as they are in their boſoms, have much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imperfections; yet as ſoon as they are put into the hand of Chriſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the ſweet incenſe of his Merits, they are glorified prayers, and have power with God to procure the thing deſired.</p>
               <p>Another priviledg is Adoption. All men in a ſenſe are the off-ſpring of God; the immortal Spirit in them had in the very make of it the natural Image of God, which was a nobler print of the Deity, than that which was upon all the material world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency was in an higher way the Son of God; the holy Graces in him, which made up the Moral Image, had more of the divine Beauty ſhining in them, than that which was to be found in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Soul: but Believers are the Sons of God in a more excellent manner; <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God,</hi> John 1.12. By
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60571:137"/>conjunction with Chriſt the natural Son, they become adopted ones. <hi>Adam</hi> was a Son only by Creation; his Soul had in the Eſſence of it a natural Image of God, and in the holy Graces of it a Moral one; but Believers are ſons by myſtical union with Chriſt the natural Son; neither is this a meer empty title, but they are born of God, they are of the ſeed-royal of Heaven; the Blood of God runs in their conſciences; the divine Spirit, which formed Chriſt in the womb, doth by a ſupernatural over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing, form him in their heart; in their adoptive Sonſhip there is a ſhadow of the eternal one; the ſplendor of grace in them, reſembling God in a meaſure, is a little picture of Chriſt, who is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers glory. This priviledg, as it is from God, is a piece of admirable love: <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 John 3.1. The Apoſtle ſtands and wonders at it as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of glorious and amazing Eminence: Alſo, as it is upon Believers, it is a piece of incomparable Dignity, ſuch as doth far outſhine all that luſtre which is upon the Potentates of this world; all the glory of earthly Princes is but <hi>fumus ſeculi,</hi> the ſmoak of this lower Region, their titles glitter
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60571:138"/>only in carnal eyes; but adoption is <hi>radius coeli,</hi> a ray of heavenly glory, making be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, though but worms in themſelves, ſhine to the eyes of Angels, who look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as myſtical parts of Chriſt. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this priviledg, I ſhall only touch on two or three things.</p>
               <p>Believers as Sons have an heavenly free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the ways of God. They are not drag'd to holy things by the cords of Hell and Death; they do not bring forth their duties meerly under the preſſure of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter, or in the power of fallen nature, in a dead, carnal, ſervile manner; no, they are ſpirited for holy things; the Law is in their hearts; the rectitude of the commands attracts them; the Love of Chriſt conſtrains them; the great rewards in Heaven raviſh them; the Holy Spirit inſpires obedience into them; Holineſs becomes natural to them; Duties are brought forth in the eaſineſs of the new creature; they can walk, run, fly on, in the pure ways towards eternal happineſs: this is a very choice priviledg indeed; they are no longer in the ſtraits of ſin and earth, but in a divine amplitude and liberty; their hearts reſt not in<note n="*" place="margin">Liber ab infinito, ad infinitum, ſuper infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur.</note> finite things, but go out to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite One; their thoughts are upon the firſt Good, their aims at the laſt End; their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60571:138"/>liberty is joyned to its great fountain; their motion is to the true center: this is a right, noble, royal poſture of Soul towards God, in whom all our happineſs is.</p>
               <p>Believers as Sons live under the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Indulgences of God; in temptations he bears them up upon the wings of grace; in a world of ſnares he plucks their feet out of the net; when the fleſh hangs back, and cumbers them in holy Duties, he helps them on by the ſweet ſupplies of his Spirit; when they totter, and are ready to fall, he upholds them with his Almighty hand; that their perſons may not be hurt, he will keep them night and day; that their graces may not decay, he will water them every moment; in their wants his treaſures are at hand to ſupply them; in their afflictions he himſelf is afflicted, as taking them to his heart; in fainting fits he hath rich cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for them; in the midſt of encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing infirmities, he ſpares them as a man ſpares his own Son that ſerves him; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy follow them all their days; a ſtream of graces and comforts perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompany them, to ſupply and refreſh them in the way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Believers as Sons ſhall have the heavenly Inheritance; <hi>If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60571:139"/>All the children are heirs of God as their Father, and joint-heirs with Chriſt as their elder Brother; the Father would not have his natural Son only inherit the bleſſed Kingdom, but his adopted ones too. Chriſt the elder brother would not reign alone there, but have all his brethren come and partake of his Glory with him: Here's Honour in the higheſt pitch; Happineſs in the utmoſt perfection; admirable is that Grace which gives it; precious is that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that procures it for us.</p>
               <p>Another priviledg is this; They that are in union with Chriſt, have the Holy Spirit in them; it is the Dignity of man, that he hath an immortal Spirit in him; touching which, the Philoſophers ſpeak at a very high rate; it is (ſay they) a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the divine Breath, a bud or bloſſom of the Deity, a kind of <hi>Daemon,</hi> or God in us: but, which is a much greater thing, it is the Dignity of a man in Chriſt, that he hath an higher Spirit than his own, no leſs than the Holy Spirit of God in him: If the Spirit of wiſdom and underſtanding be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. then it follows, <hi>That the earth is full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> verſ. 9. The Holy Spirit, which is upon him, is diffuſed unto his members: The Oyl of gladneſs,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60571:139"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. doth not only glad him, but his fellows too; though not in equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency with him, yet in a fit proportion for them as members of him: this is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful priviledg. The Holy Spirit works the great work in them; it inſpires a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life into them; it doth as in the firſt Creation command the light to ſhine out of darkneſs; it calls the holy Graces, which before were not, into being; it raiſes up the new creature out of nothing; nay, as it were, in mighty waters, in the midſt of that torrent of corruption which is in the heart; putting back the ſtream of nature, it ſets up a noble ſtructure of grace in them; it accommodates graces to every faculty, as the dew is white in the Lilly, and red in the Roſe; ſo the Holy Spirit in its Graces is light in the mind, liberty in the will, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the affections; alſo it accommodates ſutable influences to every grace; it gives ſuch ſweet touches upon their holy love, fear. meekneſs, patience, as makes them go forth into act in a free ſpontaneous manner; it acts ſo powerfully, as if there were no room left for humane liberty; and yet ſo connaturally, as if there were no power at all in it. Further, It accommodates it ſelf to them at every turn; it is a Spirit of Grace in their penitential meltings; a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60571:140"/>Spirit of ſupplication in their ardent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; a Spirit of Revelation in their Evangelical Studies; a Spirit of Love in their Charities; a Spirit of Power in their Infirmities; a Spirit of Fear in their holy Walkings; a Spirit of Meekneſs in their carriage towards others; a Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their Afflictions; a Spirit of Glory in their Reproaches; a Spirit of Holineſs in all their Converſes; it lives, breathes, moves, aptly operates in them. Hence in all their good actions, they are lifted up above themſelves, and carried beyond the line of a meer humane Spirit; they walk in a divine circle from God as the firſt cauſe, to God as the laſt end; they center on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than God himſelf, and take an aim no lower than his Glory; whether they eat, or drink, or pray, or hear, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good thing they do, they are ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the great deſign, that God in all things may be glorified; the great <hi>Alpha</hi> is their <hi>Omega;</hi> the ſupreme good is their ultimate end; they dare not center in a creature, or make God a Medium: this is practical blaſphemy; and in effect it ſaith, That God is not God, or that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than he; it is their ſtudy how to ſerve the bleſſed God; how to ſhew forth his praiſe in an holy, humble, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60571:140"/>heavenly converſation; ſtill there is <hi>oculus in metam,</hi> a pure intention at his glory, as the great end of all; by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they are ſo joyned unto him, that all their works are ſpiritualized, and attain a kind of Immortality. This is an excellent priviledg indeed, they are acted by the Holy Spirit, and walk as Chriſt walked; he, as became the great Samplar of Sanctity, ſought his Fathers glory; they, as myſtical parts of him, tread in his divine ſteps; no fleſh on earth, but that which is ſpiritually joyned to him, doth ſo; all others are off from the great Center; their beſt works putrifie; one inferior end or other, like a worm at the root, makes them moulder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing; not being terminated in God, they are not accepted as done to him.</p>
               <p>Another priviledg is this; They that are in Chriſt, have not meerly Ordinances, but communion with God in them. They ſee his goings in the Sanctuary; they have the golden Oyl of the Spirit communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf through the golden Pipes: this communion is a divine entercourſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between God and them. There are two things, ſomewhat on their part an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to ſomewhat of Gods, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what on Gods part anſwering to ſomewhat of theirs.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:60571:141"/>
               <p>On their part there is a ſervice anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the call of God; God ſaith, <hi>Seek ye my face:</hi> they anſwer, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will we ſeek.</hi> God appoints Ordinances, they perform Services in correſpondence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. There are two things in Ordinances, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner:</hi> there is that in their Services which complies with both. As to <hi>Matter,</hi> an Ordinance is a thing appointed by God, accordingly they go to it as ſuch: A worſhip of humane invention is to them as nothing, nay, worſe than nothing; it is as ſtrange fire, or as a graven Image, a kind of <hi>Teraphim,</hi> expreſſing, though not, as they did, an humane ſhape, yet an humane device or invention: But where there is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods inſtitution, where he hath ſet his own ſeal and ſtamp, there they fly as Doves to the windows, thither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to meet the Holy God; they know aſſuredly, that there is the way in which he is to be found; there he records his name, and commands the bleſſing, even life for evermore; the call is that which makes them run; the inſtitution is that which makes them wait for the benediction. As to <hi>Manner,</hi> an Ordinance is to be uſed like it ſelf, in an holy way, accordingly they treat it as a ſacred thing; their hearts are in ſuch a poſture as correſponds to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60571:141"/>of God in it: He is the great Majeſty of Heaven; they lye low before him; their reverence ſhews Him, whom they ſerve, to be an Infinite one: Oh! what abaſing thoughts are there in their boſom! Duſt here approaches to Majeſty it ſelf, nay, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful duſt to the holy One. What a little, very little thing is the ſoul to him, though it were intirely given up to him! And how much leſs is it, when corruption holds back, and the world ſteals away a great part of it from him? He is a Spirit, they ſerve him in Spirit and Truth; they endeavour to give him their higheſt and pureſt intention; they bid the world ſtand by, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them; were it poſſible, they would not have ſo much as a glance or a broken thought towards carnal objects; he is Mercy and Love it ſelf; their Faith in and through the great Mediator aſcends up to him for pardon and acceptance; their Love takes fire at his, and inflames their hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; He is the great Author of the Ordinance; he only can bleſs it; their eyes are up to him; their hearts cry out for him; Oh! that he would fill the Ordinance with his Spirit; that he would caſt their minds into the mould of the Goſpel! this is all their expectation, to meet with him in his ways. Here is the firſt correſpondence.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:60571:142"/>
               <p>On Gods part there are ſuch divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, as do in a way of Grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Services; as they draw near to him, ſo he draws near to them; as they come to Ordinances as Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, ſo he comes down into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as his own Inſtitutions, to fill them with his gracious Preſence: there are ſuch ſpirations and influences of the Spirit; ſuch openings of Evangelical Glories and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſuch deep and intimate impreſſions of Truth; ſuch delights and ſpiritual ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities in holy things; ſuch proſpects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude and beauty in the commands; ſuch ſweet taſtes and favours of Grace in the promiſes; ſuch ſheddings of the divine Love and Favour; ſuch a <hi>Shechinah,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and glory in the Ordinance, that they can do no leſs than break out, and ſay, God is in it of a truth. Before, they did by the word know the Ordinance to be of God: but now they know it by experience; God ſhews a wonderful reſpect to their ſervices; I may add, to the pious mode of them. The more low and humble they are, the nearer is the high One to them; their humility and penitential frame ſets his Mercies a melting and working towards them; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was repenting, his Soul was grieved for them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.16. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60571:142"/>himſelf, the divine bowels were troubled for him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. The more upright they are, the more doth his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance behold them; With the upright he will ſhew himſelf upright; their pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ſhall have a Crown of pure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; while they are ſerving him in heart and ſpirit, he will do them good with all his heart and ſoul; they lift up their faith and love towards him; and the iſſue is, Mercy comes down upon them in greater riches and plenty: Love appears in clearer and higher manifeſtations than before; they lift up their eyes to the great Author of Ordinances, and it is not in vain; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts himſelf to them in every duty; in Prayer they meet with gales and divine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements; they have a free acceſs and manuduction to the Mercy-ſeat; they have ſweet returns of their Petitions; if not in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> in the very thing deſired, yet in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe fitter and better for them; there is an inward ſupport, which is <hi>tantamount</hi> to the bleſſing deſired; or elſe there is a wiſe tranſmutation of the bleſſing into ſomething more profitable. In the hearing of the word, they have an effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hearts; they do not only hear outwardly, but inwardly too; there are ſuch Illuminations, as are more precious
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60571:143"/>than all the lights in nature: The word, like a beam of Omniſcience, penetrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very inward parts; the ſavours of Chriſt, are as if there were a box of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spikenard broken in their hearts; the divine Spirit breathes life and power into them, to quicken them to all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende; in every Ordinance they have a practical and experimental proof, that God is in the Ordinance. This is the ſecond cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence; both evidence a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in which ſtands much of our happineſs here below; it being certain, that there is no greater good to be enjoyed than himſelf.</p>
               <p>The laſt priviledg I ſhall name, is this: They that are in Chriſt, are happy in every conditio;<note place="margin">Eth. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> a virtuous man in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a fourſquare man; caſt him which way you will, ſtill he is upon his bottom. I may much more ſay ſo of men in Chriſt; their happineſs is ſo internal and divine, that it doth not wheel or rowl about with the mutable world, but ſtands unmovable in every condition; whether the times be proſperous or adverſe, ſtill they are happy.</p>
               <p>They are happy in times of proſperity; they have outward good things in a more excellent way than others; they have a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60571:143"/>ſpecial title to them; they have them not only by Providence, but by Promiſe; they claim not upon meer Creation, but in and through Chriſt. <hi>All are yours, and you are Chriſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. They have not meerly the things themſelves, but the favour of God with them. In the bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> there are the dew and the deep; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of the Heaven, Sun, and Moon; the precious things of the Earth, Hills, and Mountains; and, to ſweeten all, there comes in at laſt, <hi>The good will of him that dwelt in the buſh,</hi> Deut. 33.13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>verſes.</hi> This good will is that which makes the ſtream of bleſſings run pure; Believers have bleſſings, and no curſe in them; a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no ſnare in it; a proſperous ſtate, and no ſorrow added to it; the light of Gods Providence, and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance are met in conjunction. Again, They look upon outward bleſſings in their dependance upon the original; they know the true ſenſe of them to be this, That their hearts may be guided to the fountain of Goodneſs; the little beams, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, point to the Father of Lights; the ſmalleſt drops of good here below, lead to the Ocean of ſweetneſs above; no ſooner do Believers open their eyes upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but they ſee the ſtamps and ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60571:144"/>of the firſt cauſe; they behold the rare Idea's of the divine Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; every thing calls upon them to fall down and adore him, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Fountain and Principle of all things. Further, They know the right uſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; they do not take Creature-comforts into their heart, which is an holy place for God, but bid them ſtand without, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the body; they do not reſt and center in them, but as Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers march on to the heavenly Countrey: in the fulleſt affluence of outward things, ſtill they cry out, <hi>Dulcius ex ipſo fonte,</hi> a ſingle God is ſweeter than all: they look upon them not as fuel to luſt, but as incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to holy Love and Obedience; they do not as abſolute Proprietors, ingroſs all to themſelves, but as faithful Stewards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to others; they know, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive outward things, not to have and to hold, but to communicate; Mercies in their hands are, as blood in the Veins, or water in the Conduit, for publick uſe; the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to them, makes them good to others; the open hand of the great Donor, makes them aſhamed to ſhut their own.</p>
               <p>Alſo they are happy in times of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. If a ſtorm of perſecution come, their happineſs is not diminiſhed, but increaſed;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60571:144"/>they never had their Souls in ſuch a poſture, they never had ſuch appearances of God, as at ſuch a time; they melt in freſh acts of repentance; God draws their pardon afreſh, and more legible than ever; they ſigh and cry for the abominations in the Land; God ſets a mark and a ſeal of diſtinction upon them; their hearts tremble for the Ark; his bowels are moved for them; their care is for his intereſt and great name; his care is to make up his Jewels; their Faith aſcends up, and fixes it ſelf upon him; his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Mercy, come down and command Salvation for them; they cry and wreſtle with him in their prayers, that that Goſpel, the glory may not depart away from them; he hears them in one meaſure of grace or other; the Goſpel, it may be, ſhall not depart from the Land, at leaſt, not from their hearts; they are toſſed in a Sea of troubles, but there is a calm within, and an Haven of reſt (to which every wave gives them a lift) near at hand; they may look to Heaven, and ſing, as the Martyr <hi>Babylas</hi> did, <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul.</hi> They are poor weak creatures, but the power of Chriſt reſts upon them; that divine Power, which bore up his humane nature in his Sufferings, bears up them in theirs; being in the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60571:145"/>are ſure to have God with them; how heavy ſoever the Croſs be, his everlaſting Arms are under them; how bloody ſoever the Perſecutor be, his rich Mercies are towards them; when great men leave them naked to their Enemies, he covers them with his wings; when outward comforts depart from them, he will never, never leave them, no more than Chriſts Divinity did forſake his Humanity; the joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is their cordial in the greateſt troubles; the Love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts, is able to ſweeten Priſons and fiery Furnaces to them; when they have leaſt of Earth, then they have moſt of Heaven; there are ſome ſparkles of glory let down into their hearts; they taſte ſome drops of the pure Rivers of pleaſure which are above.<note place="margin">Valeat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, vileart faculltates, inquit Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litta. <hi>Mart. Cent. 4. Magdeb.</hi>
                  </note> This makes them able to bid farewel to life, and all things here, that they may go, though through the greateſt loſſes and ſufferings, to be with Chriſt. Thus much touching the Priviledges of union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is a notable paſſage in <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Every thing (ſaith he) is deſigned for ſome work, Beaſts, and Plants, and Sun, and Stars; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great work he is to do. Our Saviour tells us, that it is Faith in himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. St. <hi>Paul</hi> made it his chief buſineſs, to be found in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. Sit down, O Chriſtian, and conſider where thy intereſt lies: Is it not thy intereſt to be delivered from the wrath to come, and to enjoy the bleſſed God in Heaven? Do not the pangs in conſcience, and the ſenſe of a Deity tell thee, that it is ſo? To be ſaved for ever, muſt needs be a great thing; and how canſt thou be ſaved, but by Chriſt the only Saviour? or whom doth he ſave, but thoſe that are in conjunction with him? Is it not thy intereſt to have ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate as Chriſt, to appear in the Preſence of God, and to plead for all good things for thee? Art thou not at a vaſt diſtance from God? and are not thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as a filthy rag before him? Sure it muſt be well for thee, to have a Mediator to plead and intercede for thee, that thou mayeſt have the returns of his Blood in Pardons and Graces: And how can this be, unleſs thou art joyned to him? For whom doth he ſo intercede, but for thoſe that come unto God by him? Is it not thy intereſt, to be made a Son of God, to have the Holy Spirit living and breathing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60571:146"/>in thee? How deſirable muſt Adoption be to a Child of wrath? how much doth thy natural ſpirit want a better one to new-frame and actuate it? and how canſt thou be adopted, unleſs thou art united to the natural Son? or which way canſt thou expect to have the Holy Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dwelling in thee, unleſs thou become a Member of Chriſt? Is it not thy intereſt to have communion with the great God? how excellent a thing is it, to have thy Services anſwer to Gods call, and his divine Communications anſwer to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices? This is a little Heaven here below; but without union with Chriſt it cannot be. Is it not thy intereſt to be happy in every condition? how admirable is it to have pure Mercies and comfortable Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? to have the love and gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in every eſtate? This is a choice benefit, but not to be attained but in and through Chriſt; to have him, is to have all things; to want him, is a miſery worſe than nothing: Union with him therefore is the great work of all. How earneſt ſhould our purſuits of it be? how ardent our prayers for it? how conſtant our endeavours after it? how ſhould we gad up and down from Ordinance to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ſeeking of Chriſt, breathing after
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60571:146"/>union with him, running, ſweating, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with all our might to be joyned to him? This is <hi>totum hominis,</hi> the All of man; a matter of that conſequence, that it infinitely out-ballances all things here below, it being the only thing that raiſes up our nature to its utmoſt perfection. Let us by no means ſuffer a vanity, or a luſt, or indeed a world to ſtop us in our purſuit after it; without it we cannot be happy; with it we cannot be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Marks of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion conſidered. In general, the marks are internal, no meer outward thing is a mark; the marks are cordial, no meer notion is a mark; the marks are ſupernatural, no meer moral virtue is a mark. In particular, The firſt mark is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Spirit; the ſecond is an high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt; the third is a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Bonds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, the Spirit and Faith; the fourth is a conformity to Chriſt; a conformity to him in Graces, in the riſe of them, and in the kinds; a conformity to him in Sufferings, in the mortification of Sin, and in bearing of the Croſs; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him in his reſurrection, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of mind, and newneſs of life in matter and manner. The concluſion in two words of advice; one to thoſe that are not in union with him, the other to thoſe that are in union with him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS Union with Chriſt gives a title to great Priviledges, ſo the knowledg of that Union gives the comfort of them; thoſe, who know themſelves to be in Chriſt, do read their pardon, and live in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60571:147"/>of Paradiſe; the Holy Spirit gives them a proſpect of Heaven, and ſeals them up for it: it is therefore worth our labour to enquire into the Marks of this Union. In doing this, I ſhall firſt note three things in general, and then come to particulars. In general three things may be noted.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: The marks of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are internal, no meer outward thing can amount to a mark. I ſhall give two inſtances of it.</p>
               <p>The one is this; No meer outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg can amount to a mark: It was the ancient humour of the <hi>Jews</hi> to reſt upon external priviledges; they gloried in this, that they were <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſeed of that great Saint, <hi>Abraham,</hi> who (as they ſay) performed every jot and tittle of the Law; they cryed up their circumciſion as a very great thing; it was (ſay they) equal to all Precepts, nay, Heaven and Earth could not ſtand without it; they magnified the Temple, ſaying, <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are theſe:</hi> that was the perfection of Beauty, made ſuch by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Preſence of God in it.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Lightf. Har.</hi> fo. 39.</note> Theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges lifted them up to ſuch an height, that they look'd upon all the nations of the world but as ſo many Dogs in compariſon of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But all thoſe, who had theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60571:148"/>had not an intereſt in Chriſt; the true <hi>Jew</hi> is not meerly an outward one, but an inward; the right ſeed are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, but the children of the promiſe; the great circumciſion is not in the fleſh, but the heart; it was not the outward Temple, but the inward Sanctity which God looked at. Hence the Apoſtle returns upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were void of Chriſt, the name of Dogs, and calls them in an holy mockery, the <hi>Conciſion;</hi> and aſſerts, that Chriſtians (who rejoyce in Chriſt, and have no confidence in the fleſh, of outward priviledges) are the true circumciſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2, 3. In like manner Chriſtians are very apt to reſt upon outward Priviledges; they are in the boſom of the Church; they are baptized in the name of the Sacred Trinity; they hear the ſound of the glorious Goſpel; they receive the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper. Theſe great Priviledges make them imagine themſelves to be Chriſtians indeed; but all thoſe who have theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, are not in union with Chriſt; all are not in his myſtical body; all have not the inward waſhing of Regeneration; all do not hear and learn of the Father; all do not eat the fleſh and drink the blood of Chriſt; in the midſt of their outward Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, there is nothing within to prove
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60571:148"/>them real Chriſtians; though they be in the Church viſible, yet, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Cont. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Quod palea eſt, palea eſt;</hi> that which is chaff is chaff; and, as ſoon as the wind comes, it will fly away, and ſhew it ſelf not to be in true unity with the Church.</p>
               <p>The other is this; No meer outward acts of obedience can amount to a mark. It's true, acts of Obedience, when done in a right ſpiritual manner, are ſure ſigns of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; there is in them an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gods command; a pure intention directs them to his glory; the fountain of them is internal and ſupernatural; they are right iſſues of Faith and Love: <hi>He that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in them; and hereby we know, that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.24. It is here to be noted, that to prove a man to be in union with Chriſt, it is not only requiſite that there be Obedience, but alſo that there be the Holy Spirit to quicken us thereunto. Acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (which are good, not in the manner, but in the matter only) do not amount to a mark; they are but as a body without a ſoul, or a picture without life; a man may hear, read, pray, give alms, live ſoberly, deal honeſtly; yet in all theſe move only in the ſphere of nature: Natural conſcience may
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60571:149"/>prompt him to them; ſervile fear may drive him on; vain glory may allure him; but he doth them in a carnal, not in a ſpiritual manner; <hi>in animo non facit,</hi> he doth them to himſelf, and to the world, but not to God; there is no Faith or holy Love at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of them; no pure intention at the great End; no vital activity in the performance: Acts of obedience are not evidences, meerly as they are <hi>in opere operato,</hi> in the work done, but as they are done in a ſpiritual manner. Hence our Saviour tells them, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.20. Scribes were men of the greateſt learning; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were men of the ſtricteſt Sect among the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet becauſe their righteouſneſs was a meer external one, we muſt go beyond them, or elſe we ſhall fall ſhort of that Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which all the members of Chriſt enter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this; The marks of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are cordial; no meer notion, no, not that of divine things, can amount to a mark; a man may have a great ſtock of notions, yet not be in union with Chriſt; he may know the literal ſenſe and meaning of divine Truths, yet have nothing of the ſpiritual effect and power of them upon his heart; a man of meer notions, druges in the ſervice
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60571:149"/>of ſin, as if there were no redemption; walks in his corrupt ways, as if there were no better to be found; cleaves to earth, as if there were no Heaven; hangs about time, as if there were no eternity; chuſes his luſts, as if there were no God to ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and falls in with every vanity, as if there were no Chriſt to be united unto. His no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all lie dead, there is no impreſſion made upon the will, no vital influence upon the heart, no ſavouring or ſpiritual ſenſation of heavenly things; it is but a form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, a figure or appearance only without any life in it; he knows holy truths, only to know them; he doth not love, chuſe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, practiſe them; he hath them only in notion, not in a practical way; the holy Precepts, as full of rectitude as they are, move him not to obedience; the precious Promiſes, which flow with admirable grace, attract him not into faith and love; the dreadful threatnings, in which Gods wrath appears like devouring fire, drive him not out of his iniquity; all his knowledg is by a practical error blaſted and turned away from its true end; in effect it withers and nomes to nothing. But in a man in Chriſt, the knowledg is not a meer form or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but the ſubſtance or ſpiritual ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of holy things in the heart; the notions
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60571:150"/>do not lie dead, but riſe up in life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the ſoul; holy truths do not meerly float in the brain, or ſtay in the intellect, but fall down upon the will to make it free in the ways of God, and upon the affections to inflame them towards him; the things of Heaven do now appear in ſuch glory and excellency, that they caſt the ballance in heart and life the right way; Chriſt, with whom they are united, makes every truth effectual.</p>
               <p>The third is this; The marks of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſupernatural. No meer moral virrues, ſuch as are under a common bleſſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of principles of reaſon, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a mark. In moral virtues Reaſon is the great Moderator; in acts of Juſtice it weighs out to every man his own; in acts of temperance it proportions out how far a man may drink of ſenſitive delights; in acts of fortitude it ſets down the juſt meaſures how far fear may be heard; in all, Reaſon is the chief Umpire and Empreſs, regulating and commanding every thing: In theſe moral virtues a man is in union with his Reaſon, as the ſupream faculty in him; this is indeed highly commendable; but if we might reſt here, Chriſt would not be neceſſary to us. However neceſſary he might be for expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet he would not be neceſſary for fancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60571:150"/>he need not be a vital head to us, we might be an head to our ſelves; he need not pour out his Holy Spirit upon us, our own ſpirit might ſerve the turn; we need not be in union with him, it is enough for us to be in union with our own Reaſon: All which being very abſurd, it is to be noted, that union with Chriſt is a thing of a much higher nature than union with Reaſon. The meer Moraliſt moves in an orb much lower than the true Chriſtian; the Moraliſt in a kind of ſelf-ſufficiency ſtays at home, and drinks out of the ciſtern which is in his own Reaſon; but the Chriſtian in a way of ſelf emptineſs goes out of himſelf and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of influences of Grace from Chriſt. The Moraliſt is prudentially regulated in his paſſions, that they are ſubject to his mind; but the Chriſtian is divinely renewed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that the whole man becomes ſubject unto God. The Moraliſt does his virtuous actions in compliance with his Reaſon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt faculty in him; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, does his gracious acts in compliance with the divine will, as being the ſupream rule to him. The Moraliſt acting out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles, aims at nothing higher than himſelf; but the Chriſtian acting out of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principles, directs all to the glory of God as the chief end. Theſe things make
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60571:151"/>it appear, that moral virtues, though good in their kind, are ſo far ſhort of ſpiritual graces, that they cannot in themſelves be marks of our union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having laid down theſe three things, I ſhall now proceed to the particular marks of this union.</p>
               <p>The firſt mark of this union is poverty of ſpirit. Every man naturally is poor in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, his humane nature lies in the ruines of the fall; there is a <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> a void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Spiritual emptineſs in it; his mind is empty of ſpiritual light, and hath only ſome few reliques left to make him a man; his will is void of divine freedom, and hath only ſuch fragments of liberty, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him a free agent; his affections have loſt their wings, and creep only upon the things here below; corruption is very ſtrong, and there is a meer <hi>Vacuum</hi> of grace: it is with him, as if the Divine Image or likeneſs had never been ſtamp'd upon him; a vaſt debt of original and actual guilt lies upon him, and he hath nothing to pay; or, if Divine Juſtice ſeize him, he hath nothing to ſay againſt it; he is ſhut up under wrath and cannot but deſerve it: Thus every man, is very poor in ſpirituals; yet, alas! he is not naturally poor in ſpirit; no, on the contrary he preſumes all is well; he is, as he dreams,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60571:151"/>happy in his ruines, full in his emptineſs, ſeeing in his darkneſs, free in his chains, and rich in his debts and wants; a man poor in ſpirit, is one who is poor in ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his poverty; he conſiders his loſt and undone condition; he feels and groans under his ſpiritual wants; the deep ſenſe of them makes his heart cry out, Oh! I am loſt, I am in the ruines of the fall, there I muſt lie, unleſs Chriſt lift me up, and bring forth a new Creation out of the <hi>Chaos;</hi> my mind is dark, my will fettered with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo it muſt be, unleſs Chriſt ſhine into my heart, and make me free indeed; my poor affections lie in the duſt and vanity of this lower world, and there is no help, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſt come and raiſe them up to the things above. I find nothing but an empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and voidneſs of grace; neither is there any hope, unleſs the Spirit of Chriſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a furniture of graces and comforts; my debts are great and never to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the blood of Chriſt, which paid for the ſin of a world, do it for me. After ſome ſuch manner as this he lies at the feet of Chriſt; he is poor, empty, forlorn, deſtitute in himſelf; the very frame of his heart prays for a Saviour; ſuch an one is in a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for him. His poverty cries for an Alms out of the infinite treaſures in Chriſt; his
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60571:152"/>wearineſs pants after the true reſt which is in a Mediator; the broken heart begs for a compaſſionate hand to bind it up; the wounds in conſcience open for the atoning blood to be poured into them; the ſin ſick ſoul calls for the great Phyſician, Lord, heal my ſoul, for I have ſinned againſt thee; the lamented ruines invite the Divine Builder to ſet up his own Temple there; the ſpiritual nothingneſs importunes for a new Creation to be brought forth; <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God:</hi> Every want, being felt to the quick, hath a voice in it, and cries out for a ſupply; ſuch an one, though he know it not, is indeed in union with Chriſt; our Saviour pronounces him a bleſſed man, one to whom the Kingdom of Heaven belongs, which could never be in a ſtate ſeparate from him who purchaſed it for us; there are ſome rayes of Faith in him which unite him to Chriſt; ſome touches of the Holy Spirit, which make him look towards ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The next mark of this union, is an high eſtimation of Chriſt. In the Spouſes eye he <hi>is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, altogether lovely,</hi> Cant. 5.10, and 16. To them that believe he is precious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. every thing in him is attractive.</p>
               <p>He is precious in his perſon; he is <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God and man in one; his Deity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60571:152"/>perfection; his humanity is full of the rich anointings of the Spirit; the union of the two natures is a pledg that God would be at one with us; the rich anointings of the Spirit make his humane nature to be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Grace, to run over and fill all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the world; every thing in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is amiable, none neglect him but thoſe that are at a diſtance from him: all that are in union with him, ſet the higheſt rate upon him; in their eyes other things are but droſs in compariſon of him; they put by all the world to ſet their hearts upon him; they caſt away all their Idols to make room for him in their inner man; they part with carnal ſelf, to eſpouſe him in the higheſt love; they chuſe him not meerly for his excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but chiefly for his incomparable perſon; they reſt not in his choiceſt gifts, but lift their affections up to him the great donor: nothing is ſo valuable to them as he.</p>
               <p>He is precious in his active and paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; he fulfilled righteouſneſs, and bare the curſe for us; he did bleed and dye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs to make an atonement for us; his ſufferings (being by his Deity elevated into a kind of Infinity) were of value enough to pay for the ſin of a world; he hath ſatisfied Juſtice to the full, and withal hath opened a door of mercy to us. And what things
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60571:153"/>are theſe! how highly to be valued! to ſlight them, is to ſay we have no part in them; all, who by union with him ſhare in them, prize them above a world; the very life of their ſouls is bound up in them; here's their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge againſt the ſtorm of wrath which hangs over them as ſinners; here's the only plea to the Law which pronounces a Curſe on them as tranſgreſſors; here's the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for ſin, the only ſat is faction to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; here's their truſt, confidence, prop, center of reſt; no tears, prayers, ſervices, good works, nothing can ſatisfie their hearts, but that which ſatisfied Gods. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, That Chriſt was as freſh to him now, <hi>ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſi hâc horâ fudiſſet ſanguinem,</hi> as if he had ſhed his blood this very hour. Thoſe that are in Chriſt, find as much ſweetneſs in his blood, as if they had ſtood by the Croſs, and ſeen the ſhedding of it for them.</p>
               <p>He is precious in his Words. Neverman ſpake as he did; what he declared, was brought down out of the Fathers boſom; his myſteries are heights and depths; his commands all rectitude and equity; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the effluxes of infinite grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; every thing that dropt from his lips was divine; not to taſte ſuch things as theſe, is to be without ſenſe; thoſe that are in Chriſt, ſet an high rate upon them; they ſit at his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60571:153"/>feet to hear him; they do not only hang his words about their heads, but keep them in the midſt of their hearts, as being their life, they hold them, and will not let them go; no not in ſuffering times, in which their own lives may be called for to be laid down in pawn for them. The high Myſteries which are above the ſphere of their reaſon, are meat for their faith; the righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which the carnal heart would turn off, are the only Canon of their lives; the precious Promiſes, though chiefly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the things of another world, are to them as ſo many Honey-combs of grace to ſweeten every condition; every truth of Chriſt is dear to them.</p>
               <p>He is precious in the influences of grace; he received gifts to give them out to men; he had the Spirit above meaſure, that he might communicate it to them. He is an Head ever working in his members; a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace ever running out towards them. Thoſe that are ſeparate from him, make nothing of this; but all that are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him highly eſteem of it. He is to them as the wind to the ſails, to fill them with holy gales; and as the Sun and rain to the flowers to make a ſpring of graces in them. Whileſt he is influencing on them, all is well; they live, and their holy Principles are in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60571:154"/>motion. Should he withdraw from them, there would be nothing but dying and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, they would ſoon be as a branch without a root, or a member without an head. The influences of grace from him are as dear to them as the breath in their noſtrils. He that thus values Chriſt, may be ſure that he is in him; none that are out of him do ſo.</p>
               <p>Another mark of this Union is a tender reſpect to the bonds of it. The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> held Chriſt, and would not let him go. St. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>follow after to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that for which he was apprehended of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.12. Thoſe that are in union with him, are unwilling to leave him. In him they have light, life, grace, peace, ſalvation, heaven, and where can they be better? It is in their heart never to part with him, but always to abide in him. To this end they make it their care to maintain the bonds of union, they carry a tender reſpect to faith, and to the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>They have a tender reſpect to faith; it is not enough to them to have faith, but they uſe all means to ſtrengthen it; they are much in the Scriptures to refreſh it there; they go to the Lords-Supper to feed it there; they cry out in ardent devotions for the encreaſe of it; they put forth often
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60571:154"/>acts of it to make it more vigorous; and all this is, becauſe it is the choice unitive grace, the golden pipe that lies at the fountain of grace, the ſacred bond that tyes them to the Head in Heaven. Should this fail, they would be broken off from Chriſt; it would be all one with them, as if there were no Chriſt, no fountain or head of grace; as if there were no influences or ſtreams of grace from him. What <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate in a ſcoff ſaid of the faith of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Naz. Orat. <hi>1.</hi> in Jul.</note> That it was their only wiſdom; that they find true in good earneſt. Faith is their great concern, to ſtrengthen it is their daily work. They call upon their ſouls to adhere unto Chriſt for ever; they cry out unto God to increaſe their faith, to help their unbelief; they never think their faith ſtrong enough, nor their union with Chriſt near enough. They would be more grounded and ſetled in faith, they would be in more cloſe and intimate conjunction with Chriſt. This is the temper of thoſe that are in him.</p>
               <p>Alſo they have a tender reſpect to the holy Spirit, the other bond of union: It is the holy Spirit which firſt takes hold on them; which works faith and other graces in them; which is the very life of their ſouls and graces; which makes them breathe in prayer, melt in charity, move in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60571:155"/>act like myſtical parts of Chriſt in conformity to him; ſuch operations as theſe endear the Spirit to them. They would not grieve him for a world, they will not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ſenſual pleaſures, that they may be filled with him. They put away all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, envy, malice, hatred out of their hearts, that the good Spirit may dwell in them. They will not ſuffer worldly things to throng and make a noiſe in their minds, that the Holy One who hath a Temple there, may not be diſturbed. They would do nothing to cauſe him to withdraw his Preſence from them; it being more toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their eyes to have their own ſouls part from their bodies, than to have him depart from their ſouls. He cannot depart, but their light, life, grace, peace, will be all gone. It's a grievous thing to them to quench him. The light which he lets in, is to them more precious than that of the Sun, Moon, and Stars. The motions which he inſpires, are to them more dear than the breath in their noſtrils. The ſtill voice which he utters, is to them more ſweet than all the charms of the world. It is one of their great cares to walk in his light, yield to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and obey his voice. He comes, <hi>velut imber ſanctificationis,</hi> as a ſhower of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from Chriſt their Head; he comes
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60571:155"/>to inlighten, ſtrengthen, quicken, actuate, comfort, guide them to the bleſſed region above; and how welcome do they make him? All the dews and diſtillations of grace find their hearts open, every gale and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration meets with a compliance in them. When they have moſt of him, they ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more of him; that corruptions may be more ſubdued, Ordinances more filled, Truths more illuſtrated, Holineſs more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, Promiſes more ſealed, the love of God more ſhed abroad in their hearts. They never think themſelves to have enough of him. This is the right temper of thoſe that are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Another mark of this Union is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Chriſt. A wicked man while ſuch, cannot be in union with him: <hi>What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath light with darkneſs? What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> Can his blood ſave thoſe that are void of his Spirit? May his Promiſes comfort thoſe that trample his Laws under their feet? No ſurely, ſuch are indeed not members of Chriſt, but of Satan; not heirs of Salvation, but children of wrath. All that are in union, with Chriſt, are conformed to his Image. Every branch in him anſwers to the root. Every member ſuits to the Head in Heaven; all that are in him do in a meaſure reſemble him. In this
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60571:156"/>Conformity three things may be noted.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, There is a Conformity in graces, <hi>Beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, as by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. We have here the two bonds of Union, faith ſet forth by a transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view of Chriſt, and the Spirit called the Spirit of the Lord. And withal we have here mention of a change into the Divine Image, which ever accompanies the Union<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and is a ſure mark of it. In this Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two things may be obſerved.</p>
               <p>There is a conformity of their graces in the riſe of them, to the conception of Chriſt his humane nature was not brought forth <hi>generatione ſed juſſione,</hi> not in an ordinary way by knowing a man, but in an extror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, by the power of the Higheſt, and the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conformity to this the new Creature with its graces is not born of blood, nor of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man but of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. It is not by an hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane, but by a Divine power; It is not fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mans Spirit, but from Gods overſhadowin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the heart. The ſame Spirit which forme Chriſt in the womb, forms him in the hear. All the graces of believers are produced like their Saviours fleſh, in a pure ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way.</p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:60571:156"/>
               <p>Again, there is a conformity of their graces in the kinds of them to the graces in Chriſt; the ſame holy Spirit which anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his humane nature in an Hypoſtatical union, anoints believers in the Myſtical one. <hi>Of his fulneſs they receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. Grace in a meaſure anſwering to the grace in him. Was he meek and lowly? they have a meaſure of thoſe lovely graces. Did he burn with zeal for the glory of God? ſome of the ſame holy fire is in their hearts. Was he full of love to God and man? their love inflamed by his, goes out towards both. Was he holy in perfection? they are ſo in ſincerity. Had he large bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy and compaſſion unto men in miſery? their hearts alſo melt with the ſame graces. Was he perfectly obedient to his Fathers will? they are upright and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do it; their graces anſwer to thoſe in him, this is an infallible ſign of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If a man would know, whether he be in Chriſt or not, he muſt look within, and ask his own heart, what is there, hath the holy Spirit been there? Is there any thing above nature wrought? Are there any pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the new Creature, or Divine Image? What is there of humility, zeal or holy love? What of purity, mercy or obedience? See how it is within; if a meer <hi>vacuum</hi> be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60571:157"/>there, if the heart be void of theſe graces, it is a vain preſumption to think that he is in union with Chriſt; that there ſhould be humility in the Head, and pride in the members; zeal and love in the Head, and coldneſs and hatred in the members; purity, mercy, and obedience in the Head, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, cruelty and rebellion in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is a thing too abſurd to be imagined by any conſidering man. That Chriſt ſhould be an Head, and not communicate his Spirit, or men ſhould be members, and not receive it; that he ſhould be Head, and not rule his members; or they ſhould be members, and of a contrary temper to the Head, is utterly impoſſible. The beams of the Sun may ſooner be dark, than the members of Chriſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him. The ſtreams of a ſweet fountain may ſooner be bitter, than thoſe that are united to the fountain of Grace can want it. All that are in him have grace anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his. This is the firſt Conformity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, there is a conformity in ſufferings; they that are in Chriſt are made conformable to his death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. There are two things in this conformity; There is a conformity to his ſufferings in the mortification of ſin, <hi>Our old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>We ſuffer in the fleſh, ceaſing from ſin,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.1. What Chriſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60571:157"/>ſuffered in his pure fleſh by way of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe that are in him ſuffer in their corrupt fleſh by way of mortification. Was he arraigned and condemned to die? they ſerve ſin ſo. He was charged with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they charge it upon ſin, which in its rebellion blaſphemes Gods Soveraignty; in its turpitude, his Holineſs; in its ſecrecy, his Omniſcience; in its ingratitude, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in its folly, his Wiſdom; and in all, his glory. He was charged to ſay, <hi>That he could deſtroy the Temple;</hi> they charge it upon ſin, which hath laid thoſe ſouls, which were made to be Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſpiritual ruins. The mind of fallen man lies in darkneſs; the will in the chains of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; the affections in the grave of earthly things. They adjudg ſin unto death as being the greateſt of evils. Was he ſtript? they deal ſo with ſin. They unvail and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it, pluck off its falſe colours, diſrobe it of all its pomps and ſhadows of ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goodneſs, and make it appear in its ugly hue and nakedneſs, ſo that it looks as it is, ſinful ſin, and an evil of evils, a thing moſt worthy to be crucified. Was he nailed to the Croſs? they nail ſin there, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the inward corruption, that it cannot go at large, and riot in open ſcandals; no, nor ſteal out in an evil thought, but it will be arreſted in its paſſage to the will; they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60571:158"/>ſet guards within and without, that it may not creep in by the ports of ſenſe, nor riſe up out of the deep of the heart. Within there is a watch over the thoughts, and without over the ſenſible objects. There are ſuch nails of reſtraint, that it cannot move or ſtir it ſelf, but it dies away by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little. Was he pierced? they pierce ſin, and let out the vital blood; I mean the love and joy, and delight of it. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious thing in their eyes to love that which crucified their dear Saviour, and makes war upon their good God; to joy in that which hath been their ſorrow, and ſet the whole Creation a groaning about their ears; or to delight in that which in it ſelf is a meer ataxy and confuſion, and in the ſoul is an helliſh blot and turpitude. It is their daily work to caſt it out of their hearts as an accurſed thing, and in an holy hatred to purſue it to the death. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to Chriſt they put upon it, till it do, like one upon a Croſs, give up the Ghoſt. This is a ſure mark of union with him; <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. They have done it; and becauſe ſin is long a dying, they are ſtill a doing of it more and more. If a man indulge his luſts, it is a meer vanity for him to imagine that he is in Chriſt, he cannot at the ſame time be a ſubject of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60571:158"/>Chriſt, and a drudg to ſin; he cannot be joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a crucified Saviour, and to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifier too; his heart cannot at once be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghoſt, and a ſtable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean luſts; theſe things are utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. All that are in Chriſt die to ſin, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his death the great pattern of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and from it a ſpirit for the work.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a conformity to his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in bearing the Croſs; they that are in him in their firſt Eſpouſals, did receive him intirely, Croſs and all; and ſo virtually and in purpoſe, did ſwallow down all the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that were to go along with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And if God call them out to it, they are ready to take up the Croſs, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in their fleſh; the ſatisfactory ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt in his natural body were full and perfect, but the ſufferings of Chriſt in his Myſtical body are daily to be filled up, and all that are in him are content to bear their part in them. Chriſt hath ſanctified the way of affliction by going himſelf in it to glory; and they are willing to follow him in thither. He drunk up the cup of wrath to the bottom, and they are content to take ſuch drops of it as are allotted to them. In the midſt of afflictions and bloody ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they carry themſelves as parts of the holy Lamb, ſome of his meekneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60571:159"/>reſts upon them to tell the world that they are his; they do not murmur at inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſubmit to the will of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſits in Heaven and orders all; they do not wave the Croſs, but accept it as a piece of conformity to their Head, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Croſs to ſweeten it to his members. To them reproaches for Chriſt are as marks of honour. Sufferings for the Goſpel as pledges of future glory. Some of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have ſtiled their Priſons a Paradice; their Chains an ornament. This is an high proof of union with Chriſt. They that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him ſhall be ſure to reign with him. If a man be not willing to ſuffer for him, he hath not any part in him; he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him upon the terms of the Goſpel. Such an one would have a Chriſt of his own fancy, not a crucified one; a Goſpel and no Croſs in it; and an Heaven and no ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the way to it, which can never be. In ſuffering times the leaves of his profeſſion will fall off, he will appear as a meer man of this world; one who loves the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Chriſt, and fears temporal ſufferings more than eternal. A true Chriſtian he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; <hi>omnis Chriſtianus eſt crucianus,</hi> all that are in Chriſt learn the leſſon of the Croſs. This is the ſecond Conformity.</p>
               <p>The third is this; There is a conformity to the Reſurrection of Chriſt; what was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60571:159"/>done in the fleſh of Chriſt in his corporeal Reſurrection, that is done in the ſpirits of true Chriſtians in a ſpiritual One; there the ſtone was rolled away from the Sepulchre, here from the heart; there the fleſh of Chriſt was raiſed up by an Almighty Power; here the Spirits of Chriſtians are raiſed up by it. In this conformity, two things may be noted:</p>
               <p>There is a conformity to his Reſurrection in heavenlineſs of mind: Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt; ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God,</hi> Col. 3.1. As long as men are in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> their center is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, their affections are buried in earthly things; but as ſoon as they are in union with Chriſt, they are not here any longer, but they are riſen; their affections do not creep upon the earth, but are lifted up to heaven; their Faith puts back the things of time, and looks into eternity; theirchope takes its leave of this world, and enters in within the Vail; their Love is inflamed, and aſcends up to him who is Goodneſs it ſelf; their Souls empty out themſelves in holy Pantings and Anhelations after him; their hearts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hard after him, and can find no Sabbath of reſt but in him; every part of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creature looks up, and breathes after its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; Heaven, from whence their graces deſcend, becomes an attractive Center to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60571:160"/>them; Chriſt, who is at the right hand of Majeſty, gives ſuch holy touches upon their hearts, as lifts them up to himſelf; the main ſtream of their deſires and affections runs out towards the things above; <hi>They firſt ſeek the kingdom of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that other things may be caſt in to them:</hi> This is the temper of thoſe that are in Chriſt. An eminent inſtance of this we have in the Primitive Chriſtians, who talked ſo much of the Kingdom, the Kingdom, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors were jealous, as if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had aimed at a Kingdom here below: Indeed it is for Heathens to ſeek after this world, but Chriſtians look for a better; their treaſures and their hearts too are above; it is but meer vanity for a man, who ſets his heart upon earthly things, to ſay, that he is in Chriſt; to eſpouſe him and the world too; to be joyned to the Head in Heaven, and to Earth here below, is a thing utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; all that are in him, ſeek after the things above; as his Death morrifies them to Earth, ſo his Reſurrection quickens them to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a Conformity to his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in newneſs of life. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life,</hi> Rom 6.4. Thoſe that are in him walk in newneſs of life; they do not walk, as they did, in the way of ſin, but,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60571:160"/>as becomes them, in a way of Holineſs. In this new life, two things may be noted, the Matter of it, and the Manner.</p>
               <p>As for the Matter of it, thoſe that are in him apply themſelves to do that which God commands; they do not <hi>walk after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit;</hi> they do not walk after their own wills, but after Gods; like <hi>David,</hi> they are for all the wills of God; like <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they walk in all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; they are for both Tables, not only for Piety towards God, but for Charity and Juſtice towards men; their Piety is not hypocriſie, for it hath Juſtice and Charity joyned with it; their Juſtice and Charity are not meer Morality, for they have Piety joyned with them; as God hath coupled his Commands together in the Law, ſo they couple them together in Obedience; it is a never-failing rule, <hi>Quicquid propter Deum fit, aequalitèr fit.</hi> True obedience, as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not the command, but obeys imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; ſo neither doth it divide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but obeys equally; thoſe that are in Chriſt, have an univerſal reſpect to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Precepts; the ſame Holy Spirit which led Chriſt to a ſinleſs obedience, leads them to a ſincere one: This is the matter of a new life, it ſtands in doing that which God commands.</p>
               <p>As for the Manner of it, two things may be obſerved.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:60571:161"/>
               <p>The one is a pure intention towards the glory of God: As God is <hi>Alpha,</hi> ſo he muſt be <hi>Omega;</hi> as he is the firſt Good, ſo he muſt be the ultimate End; in all reaſon a creature ſhould be referred to its Creator, and a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good ſhould terminate in an infinite one; to center in a creature is Idolatry; to make God a Medium, is Practical blaſphemy, as if there were ſomething better than he to be enjoyed for it ſelf. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves it as an eſſential defect in the Moral Virtues of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that in them they did not look at the glory of God, but at themſelves. Hence he obſerves,<note place="margin">Contr. Jul. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that the whole body of their virtuous Works, for want of a ſingle eye at the great End, was full of darkneſs; he pronounces their Virtues to be no true Virtues; he cannot be juſt who is without the Faith of Chriſt; there cannot be true Purity in a Soul fornicating from God, nor true Virtue in which God is not ſerved; he aſſerts,<note place="margin">De Civ: Dei, lib. <hi>19.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Virtutes, cum ad ſeipſas referun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, inflatae &amp; ſuperbae ſunt;</hi> they are no longer Virtues, but pieces of pride and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither need we wonder at this, the <hi>Pagans,</hi> not being in union with Chriſt, nor having any touches from his Reſurrection, had but a meer humane Spirit in them, which elevates a man no higher than himſelf. Our Saviour charges them with hypocriſie, who faſt, pray, and give alms, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60571:161"/>be ſeen of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. They do but ſet themſelves upon the Stage to act a part, not to God, but to men; accordingly they have their reward not from him, but from them; who ſeeing only the outſide commend them; neither need we admire at this; theſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites believe not; they are not in union with him who elevates humane nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it ſelf; therefore all that they do, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in themſelves; but thoſe that are in Chriſt, have an higher Spirit than their own; his Spirit doth direct them in all their good works to aim at the glory of God; there is a pure intention to conſecrate all to him; their Holineſs is to ſhine as a little beam or ſpark from the holy One; the drops of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them are to point out the infinite Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Goodneſs in him; their Obedience is to tell the world that he is the Supreme Lord of all; their Sincerity is to teſtifie his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience; all that good they do, is to ſerve his intereſt, and ſhew forth his praiſe; ſtill there is <hi>oculus in metam,</hi> a pure intention at his Glory. The Church tells us, that all her fruits were laid up for Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Propter te, Domine propter te,</hi> is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Motto in all his good Works. Now, if we look into our hearts, and ſee the ſpring of actions there, we may clearly ſee, whether we are in Chriſt or not. Whoſe Will do we look at, Gods or our own? What is our
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60571:162"/>Rule and Center? Do we aim at the great End? Do we indeed deſire, that God in all things may be glorified? If we do ſo, it is a ſure ſign, that we are united to Chriſt; we know the power of his Reſurrection, and by his Spirit are lifted up above our ſelves to the great End of all things.</p>
               <p>The other is an humble dependance upon the influences of Chriſt the Head; as in Chriſt perſonal, the humane nature depends upon the divine; ſo in Chriſt myſtical, the members depend upon the head; as Chriſts humane nature acted in union with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſo Chriſtians do all in union with Chriſt; there is a Spirit flowing from Chriſt, which touches and moves all his members. Hence they are ſaid to live in the ſpirit, pray in the ſpirit, walk in the ſpirit, do all in the ſpirit which deſcends upon them from the Head. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. He lived an holy life, but it was in dependance upon Chriſt; he did the Will of God, but he was acted by the Spirit of Chriſt in the doing of it: there is a vaſt difference between a meer Moraliſt and a right Chriſtian; the Moraliſt cries up the Fountain of Virtue in his own reaſon and will; the Chriſtian cries up the Fountain of Grace in Chriſt; there are the full treaſures of Grace; there are the rich anointings of the Spirit. The Moraliſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60571:162"/>all,<note place="margin">Epict. Ench. c. <hi>17.</hi> Sen. Ep. <hi>31.</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from himſelf; and in all doth <hi>ſibi fidere,</hi> truſt to himſelf. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hangs upon Chriſt, and adheres to him, that he may have continual ſupplies of grace from him; the Moraliſt is a ſelf-ſubſiſter, he ſtands upon his own bottom, works out of his own ſtock, and is All to himſelf; the Chriſtian ſubſiſts in Chriſt, he is a branch in him; in the root he flouriſhes, off from it he withers; he is a member of him, in union with the head he acts and moves in holy Works, in ſeparation from him he can do nothing; he waits and looks up to him, that he by the influences of his Spirit, may inlighten him when dark, quicken him when dead, draw him when back ward, ſtrengthen him when weak, hold him when falling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large him when in ſtraits, and actuate him to do Gods Will in the midſt of infirmities; in all the good works that he doth, he acts in dependance upon the influences of grace. Here again we may try our ſelves whether we be in Chriſt or not; how is it with us? what is the poſture of our inward man? do we live in dependance upon Chriſt our Head? do we ſanctifie the Fountain of grace in our hearts? do we look up to him to move and act us by his Spirit? if ſo, it is ſure that we are members of him, and live like ſuch in dependance upon him.</p>
               <p>I will no longer inſiſt upon the marks of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60571:163"/>union, but conclude all with two things:</p>
               <p>The one is this; Thoſe that are not in union with Chriſt, had need to conſider their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what poor forlorn creatures are they? what a world of guilt is there lying at their door? what omiſſions, comiſſions, ignorances, preſumptions, impieties, iniquities, what ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered light, abuſed love, forfeited creatures, buried talents, broken promiſes have they to anſwer for? and for theſe things, what black clouds and ſtorms of wrath hang over their heads? what dooms and fearful curſes doth the broken Law pronounce againſt them? at death and judgment what will they do? how will they appear before the Holy God? or what can they ſay or plead why his wrath ſhould not be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? may they be ſaved without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, or by a neglected one? will the great and merciful Jeſus deliver thoſe that would not join themſelves to him? may his glorious ſatisfaction cover thoſe that are none of his members? or his precious atonement diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thoſe that would never receive it? will the Law ſpare thoſe that refuſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? or the dreadful curſe paſs over thoſe who have none of the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſprinkled upon them? It cannot be; not being in union with Chriſt their condition is as forlorn, as if there were no Chriſt, no ſacrifice or atonement, no Goſpel or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60571:163"/>at all, the wrath of God abides upon them, there is but a moment, a little ſpan of life between them and the bottomleſs pit; as ſoon as death blows out their Candle, they are in utter darkneſs: It may be a matter of juſt wonder, how it is poſſible, that they ſhould have any reſt or quiet of mind in ſuch a dreadful condition; the very thought of the wrath to come, is enough to dampall the joy and comfort of their lives. Again, Would they put dive into their own hearts, it would be a weary thing to them, to ſee their immortal ſpirits lye as they do, in ruins and ſpiritual deſolations; to have minds, and no practical light in them; wills, and no holy rectitude there; to have love and joy, and none for Chriſt; hatred and ſorrow, and none for ſin: It would be grievous in their eyes to ſee their precious ſouls lye in the turpitude and pollution of ſin, in a ſink of pleaſure, or a cave of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other luſt, which like an unclean place miſerably defiles it whilſt it abides there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: In ſuch a doleful ſtate, what help or relief is there but in Chriſt? Is not he the great repairer of breaches? Is it not he that ſets up the Divine Image and all its furniture in the Soul? is not he the only one, that cleanſes us from the ſtains and turpitudes of ſin? There i, ſalvation in no other but in him alone. Were but men awakened, they would never reſt in a Chriſtleſs condition; the ſcores of guilt in conſcience, the wrath of God hanging over their heads, the forlorn and deſperate ſtate of their own ſouls, the wretched pollutions and defilements which they lye under, would make them cry out
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60571:164"/>for Chriſt; oh! give us Chriſt or elſe we dye; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can waſh out our guilt but his atoning blood; nothing can cover us from wrath, but his glorious ſatisfaction; nothing can purge out our ſtains, and ſet our hearts in order, but his ſpirit: the fearful condition of being without Chriſt would prompt them to breathe, and endeavour after union with him, as the only neceſſary and deſirable thing in the world.</p>
               <p>The other is this; Thoſe that are in union with Chriſt, ſhould carry themſelves in a juſt decorum to that bleſſed ſtate. How ſhould they ſtudy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the tranſcendent excellencies of their head! what a glorious and incomparable perſon is he! Creatures are but vanity, the whole world is but a poor nothing in compariſon of him; what a ſight is God in the fleſh, in whom the diſtance between God and man is, as it were, filled up in a wonderful incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation! how infinite is that love which moved him to come down into an humane nature, to ſtand in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rules of his own Law; nay, to bleed and die upon a Croſs to make a full ſatisfaction for the ſin of the world? How ſhould thoſe that are in him ſtand and adore him? What rapes and extaſies of affection are due to him, who is all over beauty and amenity? With what joys and triumphs of faith ſhould they look upon that precious blood, which cheers the heart of God and man? Here they may lye down in eaſe and reſt, no fears of death or hell ſhall diſturb them. And what are the rich anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and over-meaſures of the Spirit which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him! How vaſt an Ocean of grace is he! and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60571:164"/>what wonders are to be ſeen there! Thoſe that are in him have reaſon to ſtand and admire at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual illapſes of the Spirit, and ſupplies of grace which come from him. <hi>Iſrael</hi> could ſing at an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fountain, <hi>Spring up O well,</hi> Numb. 21.17. How ſhould Chriſtians joy in the fountain of Grace, and ſay, Flow out, O infinite Well, let thy ſtreams make us glad for ever! What precious thoughts ſhould they have of him! What firm adherences of will to him! What total dependences upon him? What pure intimate affections towards him! How ſhould their love feed and feaſt upon the delicious ſuavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and plenitudes in him! Earthly things ſhould be but as ſo many beautiful ſhadows and gilded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things; their affections ſhould be intirely ſet upon him as the moſt amiable object of all; carnal ſelf ſhould be left and forſaken, that they may be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in him. How ſhould they ſtudy and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly affect to reſemble him! his will ſhould be theirs, theirs ſhould be broken to pieces, that it may be made one with his; his mind ſhould be in them, and theirs ſhould have pure aims at his glory; they ſhould never think that they have enough of his Image, but every day endeavour to have more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtamps and impreſſes of it upon their ſouls; nay, they ſhould not reſt in a meer <hi>interne</hi> aſſimilation to him, but ſtrive after an <hi>externe</hi> imitation of him, to talk and act, and live as he did; as there is one Spirit in him and them, ſo there ſhould be the ſame ſteps in both. When they go about any thing, they ſhould ask their own hearts, would he if on earth do ſo? Do we herein imitate him who is the grand
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60571:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>copy and Idea of Virtue? To hunt after the world, or drown in ſenſuality, or boil in hatred and malice, is not to act as myſtical parts of the great Samplar. And how ſhould they ſeek communion with him in Duties, Providences, in Creature-comforts! Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhould be the matter of their fruition, all other things ſhould be ſubſervient to him, nothing ſhould be good to them but what tends to him. And how ſhould they endeavour to give all content to him! the leaſt dalliances with ſin are a grief to him. The Phyſician tells us, that all grief in the body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſolution of the <hi>continuum;</hi> it holds good in his members; nothing is more grievous to him, than to have them backſlide &amp; be out of joint. If they ſhould fall off from his Myſteries to their own reaſon, or from his precepts to their own will, or from his righteouſneſs to their own works, it would be a thing no leſs diſpleaſing to him than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming to them. And how ſhould they labour to find all content in him? He is a King for power, an Husband for love, a foundation for ſupport, a Prieſt for atonement, an Head for influence. Nay, he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>all things,</hi> Col. 3.11. It is ſafe to be under his protection, ſweet to be in his embraces, ſure to be upon his bottom; comfortable to have peace by his blood; excellent to have continual ſupplys and emanations of grace from him. Nay, to have him, is to have all things; all that are in him have reaſon to reſt ſatisfied in him, and to begin that Song of the Lamb, which they ſhall be ever ſinging in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him.</p>
